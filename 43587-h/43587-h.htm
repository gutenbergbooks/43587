<h2>THE WINNING OF THE CANE</h2>

<p>The modern Cane Spree is held in broad
daylight on University Field. It is a
vastly different affair from the Spree we used to
watch with chattering teeth at midnight, kneeling
on the wet grass in front of Witherspoon,
with a full moon watching over West College
and Mat. Goldie and two assistants waiting by
the lamp-post to join in the fierce rush which
followed each bout.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is one of the regular events of
the Annual Fall Handicap Games, and is advertised
in large special feature letters on the posters
hanging in the shop windows and on the bulletin
elm. It is a perfectly proper and legitimate
proceeding, and is watched like any other field
event from the bleachers and Grand Stand, with
girls there to catch their breath and say "Oh!"
The class that wins is glad. They cheer awhile
and then watch the final heat of the 2.20.</p>

<p>In our day you could seldom see much of
anything, and there was nothing proper about
it. But it was one of the things a fellow lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
for, like Thanksgiving games and Spring Term.
To win a cane for one's class was an honor of a
lifetime, like playing on the 'Varsity, or winning
the Lynde debate. Men are still pointed out
when back at Commencement as the light or
middle weight spreers of their class, and a member
of the faculty is famous for having "described
a parabola with his opponent." This
trick and a book called "Basal Concepts in Philosophy"
bear his name, though it is maintained
by some that he is more proud of the book.</p>

<p>This is to be a story of "How we used to do
when we were in college." It would not do to
revive the ancient cane spree. Things have
changed since then. We are a university now.
We mustn't behave like a college any longer.
Besides, it was bad for the football men and
training hours. But all the same, those old
times were fun while they lasted. Weren't they?</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>High up over Clio Hall hung a moon, which
a night or two before had been full. Over there,
on the balconies of Witherspoon, blue and red
and green lights were flaring. On the grass-plot
in front was a huge black circle. This was
made up of the College of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Their hats were off, and the red and the green
and the blue mingled with the moonlight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
glared upon the bare heads and the white of the
faces with an effect as ghastly as it sounds.</p>

<p>The elms over toward Reunion and West cast
long ugly-looking shadows. Beyond these everything
seemed far away and dark and silent.
Yet only a few hours before this same spot had
served the innocent purpose of batting up flies
and kicking footballs for points, with fellows
shouting in loud, careless voices, "Aw! Come
off! That was over the line!"</p>

<p>The circle was not yet perfectly formed. The
crowd shivered and fidgeted, and borrowed lights
of one another. Those behind called "Down
in front!" And everyone wished it would begin.
Some fellows kept edging in and were
shoved back again by those appointed for that
purpose. A few were moving about inside the
circle displaying rolls of bills with which they
made bets, and a great impression on under-classmen
of a certain sort. The night was to
be clear and frosty, and the strain on the nerves
tremendous. So all those who believed in artificial
warmth had it in their pockets, and some
who did not.</p>

<p>For a month it had been, next to football, the
most discussed topic at dinner-tables. Almost
as soon as the rush was over&mdash;the annual cannon
rush of the second night of the term without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
which the freshmen would not have considered
themselves a class, while the underclassmen
were still occupied in hazing and being
hazed, and putting up and pulling down each
other's proclamations throughout the state, and
painting and repainting water-towers, and losing
sleep in other good causes; in short, early in
the term the candidates for the spreeing positions
went into training, and they had been
spreeing vigorously every night since&mdash;the
freshmen back of the chapel and the sophs on
the South Campus, about where Brown Hall
now stands.</p>

<p>All sorts of rumors and counter-rumors had
floated about the campus. The sophomores
were frightened about a hinted-at dark horse of
the freshmen, only they did not show it; and the
freshmen were scared to death at the confident
air of the well-known champion of the sophomores,
and tried not to show it. And each was
awed at the mysterious air of the other, and both
had betted more than they had any business to
on the result, and were now lined up in front of
Witherspoon. All were as excited as they cared
to be, and they had been cheering for themselves
since nine o'clock. The cheers echoed in the
frosty air from dark West and bright Witherspoon,
and from far away first Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The sophomores were closely massed in the
segment of the circle on the higher ground toward
Reunion. Their cheering sounded blatant,
and to the freshmen sickeningly confident. And
the freshmen&mdash;they were opposite, with their
sweet scared faces still more closely huddled together.
Each freshman had his little cap safely
tucked away in his innermost pocket, and none
of them was saying a word, except when he
opened his mouth to cheer with all his heart
for his dear class. It was all new to them.
They only waited and waited with the same
aching suspense that you had on Thanksgiving-day,
when you saw the referee toss the
coin and one team take the ball while the
other crouched, and then waited and waited,
and you felt certain that something awful was
the matter, but you did not know what.</p>

<p>Presently, though no official sign was given,
every one felt that the important moment was at
hand. The cheering sounded as if reinforcements
had arrived. A compact circle was now
formed by composite consent. Those in the
front row sat down on the grass and caught cold.
The next row kneeled. Those behind leaned on
them, and so on back to those who stood on tip-toe
and craned their necks for an occasional
glimpse. Outside the circle, over by the Witherspoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
lamp-post, leaned Proctor Matthew
Goldie, Esquire, in a careless attitude.</p>

<p>Everyone's heart jumped up a little when a
voice cried, "Here they come!" as though it
were he who had to spree.</p>

<p>Led by their coachers, the two light weights
scudded out mysteriously from different wings of
Witherspoon with overcoats wrapped about them.
As they crossed the light, the crowd, which had
hushed for a moment, broke out in wild prolonged
cheering; the two upper classes, who were not
immediately interested, joined in. So did the
sporting gentlemen of the town, and even the little
muckers cheered shrilly for their favorite class.</p>

<p>A path was forced through the crowd, and the
two nimble light weights began peeling their
sweaters. The sophomore was dressed in black,
the freshman in pure white. They resined
their hands. Everyone felt things.</p>

<p>The referee held out the stout piece of hickory
called cane by courtesy. He put the freshman's
hands outside. The cheering ceased. Mat.
Goldie stretched and changed his position.</p>

<p>There was a hurting stillness as they stood
there with their feet braced, frozen in the ghastly
glare, the one in white and the one in black,
while the referee said, in earnest tones, "Are
you ready, freshman?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>You could see his chest filling up from the
bottom as he answered, "Um."</p>

<p>"Are you ready, sophomore?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Spree!"</p>

<p>One of them dropped as if shot, the other followed
him down, both turned over, each began
struggling and straining; the coachers began
coaching, the referee dropped down on his
knees to see fair play, and then someone in the
rear said, "Down in front!" in healthy, human
tones, and you came to yourself and remembered
that this was only a struggle for class honor,
after all, and that whichever way it came out it
was not going to kill you. Then you breathed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, locked up in a room in East Middle
Witherspoon, wrapped in sweaters and
blankets, were five other freshmen, and to them
the strain was worst of all. These were the
other freshmen spreers, the light weight, the
middle weight, and the three substitutes. They
could only wait and listen and try to guess from
the sound of the cheers which side had the advantage.
It was too far off to distinguish anything
but a ring with something undefined inside.
The juniors said they must not go out on
the balcony or get excited. This was easy to
say.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>While the crowd was in the room and fellows
were clattering up and down the stairs and everyone
was talking and the crowd outside was making
a noise, it was not so bad. But now it was so
silent they could almost hear the two contestants
straining and wrenching below. Now and then
the shrill, earnest voice of a coacher would cut
through the silence. "Now! Now!" with an
echo from the Presbyterian Church. "Right
over with him. Remember what I told you."
Once the middle weight arose from the divan;
then he sat down again. A little later one of
the subs whistled two bars of a tune and stopped
as if he had forgotten something. Once in
a while someone glanced at one of the others
and then looked away again. They did not say
much.</p>

<p>The only one who did not seem to mind it
was Hill, the substitute heavy weight, and that
was only because he had not sense enough. He
was a big, thick-headed, sleepy-looking farmer,
and the only reason he was up here with these
nimble athletes was that he was such a tremendous
buck and so stupid that when once he put
his big hands on the stick he would not let go.
But he would be used only in case the regular
heavy weight died or had a fit or something before
time was called, and that was improbable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>But Hill was enjoying everything. He thought
the colored lights were "pretty," and he considered
it good fun, loafing in this large, luxurious
room. He glanced approvingly at the
water-colors and examined the photographs and
knocked down a few of them, and looked over
the mugs and the foils and the antlers and the
usual dust collectors of a well-furnished room.
Then, because he approved of what he saw, he
grinned.</p>

<p>He had grinned at the staring crowd when,
half an hour before, it had stood to one side for
him and the other spreers to pass by on the way
back from weighing at the gymnasium. He
thought lots of things were funny. He grinned
broadly when, before the spree began, an excitable
junior approached him in the corner
where he was sitting alone and said, in jerky,
tremulous tones, "Say, which do you think will
win?" This was before the crowd was put out.
That was the funniest thing of all&mdash;the way
Cunningham put the crowd out. "Dash it! I
wish to dash you fellows would dash quickly get
to dash out of here. This is my room and, dash
it all, I loaned it to the dash freshmen spreers
and not to the whole dash college, dash it!"
That was so funny that Hill let loose his huge
laugh and filled up the room with it. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
caused the other freshmen to look at one another
and smile pityingly. But Hill did not
notice it.</p>

<p>The other freshmen had little in common
with Hill. It was not so much because he was
uncouth as that he had no class spirit. He had
entered college two days late, and those two
days are like two years in some respects. He
had missed the class meeting, where freshmen
get a first sight of one another which lasts
always, and he had missed the class rush about
the cannon, where freshmen are so closely
pressed together that they never after get quite
apart. But the farmer should have wakened up
by this time. Lack of class spirit is never pardonable.
This is the way Hill happened to be
here this evening.</p>

<p>One day early in the term, as he was pushing
his big chest across the campus to recitation, he
heard someone call: "Hold up, there, you big
freshman!" So he smiled and took off his ugly
derby hat.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not a sophomore; I'm a junior,"
said the stranger, who then explained that he
wanted to talk to him. "You come to my room
at one o'clock, and don't forget about it," said
the junior. "Run along, now; the bell is stopping."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>Hill came, and found several other freshmen
there. "Take hold of this stick," said
the junior.</p>

<p>He put his big fists about it and found himself
flying across the room. He landed against
the door and beside him lay a table, which never
arose.</p>

<p>"Now, that is cane-spreeing," said the junior
casually, as one would say, "Down there is
the new Art building," "and I want all you
fellows to meet me at eight o'clock back of
chapel."</p>

<p>That night they gave Hill a cane and said,
"Take hold of this and don't let go." He held
it for an hour against every one except the
junior that was sophomore heavy weight the
previous year. But he had never yet been quick
enough to take it away from anyone, even the
light weights. And that was the reason he was
a substitute waiting in Montie Cunningham's
room wrapped in two sweaters and a blanket.
His eyes were closed and he was thinking about
what a bully time his younger brother Ike must
be having among the chestnuts this month.</p>

<p>The big leather chair was soft and he might
have fallen asleep had not at that moment a tremendous
yell burst into existence down below&mdash;a
loud, shrill, fiendish yell which lasted nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
a minute before it was shaken down to an organized
cheer. Hill stretched.</p>

<p>The others were out on the balcony. "Tell
us which has it! For heaven's sake, tell us!"
they cried to every one below; and no one below
answered. So all they could do was to bite
their lips and wait until the yelling became
cheering, and then they knew from the exultant
tones of the sophomores what they did not want
to know.</p>

<p>Just then they caught a glimpse of the victor
waving the cane in his hand as he was borne
high on the shoulders of his class-mates to
West Witherspoon.</p>

<p>Then they had a confused view of the rush.
The upper classes fell to one side and the other
two fell upon one another. This was the fiercest
sort of rushing known to the proctors. The two
sides were not, as in the cannon rush, evenly
lined up four abreast. Not a bit of it.
There were two thickly massed bodies of men,
one running up a grade, the other charging
down, and the roll of their footsteps was as the
sound of much cattle, running. For a moment
each tried to keep in solid form. But only long
enough for some one to be knocked down and
run over by the rest. After the first crash it
was mixed fighting. In the moonlight one could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
not invariably distinguish friend from foe. So
each man doubled up both fists and let drive at
everyone he saw. It was glorious.</p>

<p>As soon as they became hopelessly mixed and
each class had cheered itself hoarse and the
proctors had carried off an armful of sophomores
to appear before the Discipline Committee
the next day, and to be cheered off at the
depot by lamenting classmates later on, everyone
turned up his coat-collar and helped form
the ring again.</p>

<p>Those on the balcony, who had been panting
and chafing like tied deer-hounds, now heard the
feet of them bearing bad tidings and the defeated
freshman up the entry stairs. The door
was kicked open and three winded juniors laid
their burden gently on the bed, which had been
dragged in from the other room for this purpose.
With them many others pushed in who did not
belong there, and the room was full of people
once more. Many voices were explaining how
it all happened.</p>

<p>Ramsay, the little freshman, was completely
done. He had fainted as they brought him upstairs.
His face was set and white, and he lay
there with his tough little resiny hands hanging
limp at his side while his classmates poured
brandy down his throat and told each other what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
to do. Through the window came a sharp
freshman cheer with "Runt Ramsay" on the
end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the middle weight had stripped to
the waist. He was bending forward with his
forearms upon the mantel-piece and his forehead
resting on them, as one bows during prayers in
chapel. Two men were vigorously rubbing his
long strong back with whiskey. The coach was
standing beside him, giving final admonitions in
a quick, tense manner. "Now, if he does this,
you do this. See? He can't get you on that
shoulder-throw of his. And if he tries this
trick you know how to meet it. Why, you can
do him dead easy. I won from him last year,
and you can take it away from me," and so on.
As they started from the room, he added, "Now
remember your whole class is watching you
and&mdash;&mdash;" But the door closed and they hurried
down the stairs, and in a moment the wild
cheering announced their entrance in the ring.
Hill was sorry, because he thought it right
funny.</p>

<p>He went out on the balcony and looked down
on the crowd. The noise and the moonlight
and the specks of cigarlight had a grotesque
effect. He had never seen anything like it before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, cork up that laugh, Farmer Hill," said
Bushforth, the heavy weight, who was also centre
of the freshman team and had a right to patronize.
"It's bad enough as it is, without that
bark of yours."</p>

<p>Hill stopped laughing. He grinned instead.
His feelings were not hurt. He had none.</p>

<p>Again the cheering was hushed. It was so
still that those on the balcony might have heard
the hard breathing or the whimpering of the
freshman on the bed. The farmer heard it and
went inside.</p>

<p>The liquor and exercise had made Ramsay
warm. He had thrown off the blankets and lay
half naked with his hands clasped across his
eyes. Drops of sweat were running off his palpitating
chest. Hill looked at his prettily developed
arms and at the slender, well-turned
wrist and at the tough little hands, which, Hill
decided, had never done much farm work.
Then because he liked what he saw, he laughed.</p>

<p>The light weight uncovered one eye and
then covered it again.</p>

<p>"There, there," said the farmer, patting the
black curly hair, which looked "pretty" against
the white pillow. "I wouldn't take on so, little
one, we'll get some of those canes yet."</p>

<p>Brandy and defeat had made Ramsay cross.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
He said: "Oh, go to the devil, won't you
please?"</p>

<p>"All right," replied the big fellow. "Only
you'll catch cold that way. Let me fix
them." He carefully tucked the blankets around
his classmate, who said, "That's so. Much
obliged." Hill smiled at his uncomfortable
tone.</p>

<p>When, after seven hard-fought rounds, Murray,
the middle weight, was brought up breathless
and caneless, there was great discouragement
in the freshman camp. The middle
weight was the one above all others upon
whom they had relied to defend the honor of
the class. Murray, the long-winded, himself
had felt confident of winning; and probably he
would have by sheer endurance had not the
sophomore taken him unawares by a very easy
finger trick as they lay together on the ground
resting.</p>

<p>But it was all over now, and the middle weight
was stretched out on the bed beside Ramsay.
He had not, however, fainted, and he was sullenly
chewing a piece of gum he had had in his
mouth during the struggle. He looked unconcerned.
He made no excuses to those who told
what a nervy fight he had made.</p>

<p>All the week previous the betting on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
heavy weight had been two to one on the sophomore.
But now three seniors from the enemy's
camp swaggered into the room shouting, "Here's
four to one on Parker. Who wants it? Why
don't you back your man?" They smiled at
the junior coachers. "Drake don't want any of
it," said another, in a dry tone; "he knows
Parker too well."</p>

<p>Drake was the man who met Parker, unsuccessfully,
the year before. "Wait a moment,"
he said. His sporting blood was stirred. "I'll
take all you have, at four to one. Charlie, will
you hold it, please?"</p>

<p>All of this must have been soothing to the
nerves of the freshman heavy weight who was
taking off his clothes for a final rub and trying
not to hear the class cheers outside.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Montie Cunningham, slamming
the door as the seniors hurried down
the stairs, "this thing's got to stop right <i>here</i>."
He brought a baseball bat down on the table
so hard that every one stopped talking and
looked up. "You've simply got to win that
cane. If those dash sophomores win all three
they'll crow over you for the rest of their
course. They are arrogant enough already,
dash them. And you fellows will be disgraced
forever, and your class will be handed down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
in history as no good. People will refer to
you as a class who lost all three canes. This is a
crisis in your history. You made a good showing
in the rush, but you were badly defeated
in the baseball series. This is the third test.
This decides it. Win this cane and you are all
right. One out of three is a defeat, but not a
disgrace, because you are only freshmen. But
<i>none</i> out of three <i>is</i>. <i>You've got to win this cane!</i>"</p>

<p>No one uttered a sound for a moment. Farmer
Hill did not laugh.</p>

<p>"Come here, Bushforth," said Drake, in a low,
solemn voice; "I'll rub you myself."</p>

<p>The heavy weight was beautifully built and
exceedingly quick for his size. He came to college
with a good prep-school record of centre
rush. But there was something disappointing
about him, and you felt it every time you saw
him move. You know the kind. One of those fellows
who are splendid to look at in a football
suit, and who will always put up a fair game on
the scrub, but who are never going to make the
'Varsity.</p>

<p>Just now he was biting his lip and looking
down at his own good legs. When he raised
his glance he found Hill standing with arms
akimbo, gazing at him with an earnest expression.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Bushforth smiled good-humoredly to show
how cool he was.</p>

<p>"Think you can take that cane?" Hill asked
with a grin.</p>

<p>"I really don't know, Hill," answered the
beautifully built man.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can take it?" repeated the
other.</p>

<p>"Well, Hill, Parker will have to work for it,"
said the heavy weight, indulgently. "Why?
Would you like to take my place? I'd be glad
to resign in your favor."</p>

<p>"All right," said Hill, simply. He began pulling
up his sweater.</p>

<p>"Go on and sit down and stop your nonsense."
It was hard to stand horse-play at such a moment,
when your whole class was cheering for
you outside.</p>

<p>"I ain't fooling," said the big farmer, with his
arms still in the sweater, his head and body
out.</p>

<p>"Hurry, Bush," said one of the juniors at the
window. "The sophs have yelled across at me
that they are ready."</p>

<p>"All right," said Bushforth, lacing his Jersey
as he started for the door. He forgot to answer
the other freshman.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the big, cheerful voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of the farmer, "I think I'll go down this
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, cork up, you big cow!" said Drake.</p>

<p>Hill corked up and then pushed Bushforth
out of the way and started for the door.</p>

<p>"Will you please go back where you belong
and sit down?" said Drake, impressively.</p>

<p>It failed to impress Hill. "Well, you see, it's
this way," he began pleasantly, "he can't take
that cane, I'm afraid. I can, though. I've got
my blood up." He began contracting his biceps
playfully. "Isn't it time to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Freshman," interrupted Drake, with irony,
"we have chosen the heavy weight representative
of your class, and we are of the opinion that
we know about as much of this business as you
do. I never heard of such foolishness. Go sit
down, and shut your big face. Your services
will not be required unless Billy is laid off
before he reaches the foot of the entry stairs.
Come on, Billy."</p>

<p>"Then," Hill answered, smilingly, "I'll have
to lay him off." He suddenly grabbed his big
classmate by the shoulders, jerked him back
into his arms, grasped him like a bag of flour,
and hoisted him on his shoulders as if he had
been one. "Now you lie down there, and be a
good boy." He dropped Bushforth, but not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
roughly, in the corner behind the door, and then
looked beamingly about at the others as though
he had performed quite a feat. And so he had.
Bushforth weighed one hundred and eighty-nine,
stripped.</p>

<p>Outside the crowd was yelling concertedly in
quick, jerky notes, "Shake it up! Shake it up!
Shake it up!" and the sophomores were singing
"Where, oh, where are the verdant freshmen?"
etc., "Lost now in the green, green soup." But
upstairs everyone was so tense and so excited that
nothing was heard but the angry words of the
coachers addressed to Hill, who was grinning.</p>

<p>Bushforth arose from the floor slowly.</p>

<p>"Shake it up, Billy," cried Drake, exasperated;
"do you want to lose your cane by default?"</p>

<p>"Say," replied Bushforth, soberly, "do you
suppose there's anything the matter with this
hand?&mdash;Ugh! Great Scott! don't squeeze it."</p>

<p>Hill had not thrown him violently, but Bushforth,
in throwing out his arms to stop himself,
had struck his left hand against the wooden
door-guard a few inches above the floor behind
the door, and all his weight was upon it. The
junior coach shut his eyes, dropped into Hill's
big chair, and let his arms fall down to his
sides. Everyone looked at him. "That settles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
it," he gasped. "Billy's hand is sprained.
Let's give up the cane by default and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it sprained?" interrupted Hill, removing
his smile suddenly. "I'm sorry I hurt his hand.
I did not intend that&mdash;Mr. Bushforth, I beg
your pardon. I just wanted to show these
fellows how strong I was. I didn't think I had
a fair trial at spreeing. And now, Drake,
don't you think we had better go down? They
are clamoring down there. Are you coming?"</p>

<p>His tones were very deliberate and his manner
so calm in contrast to the boiling condition
of the others, that everyone seemed stunned
for a moment. They only looked at one
another.</p>

<p>"Shake it up! Shake it up! Shake it up!"
came from the crowd below, and just then two
representatives from the sophomores came running
up the stairs, shouting, "Say, if you fellows
don't wish to lose this by default come right
now. Everyone's tired of waiting."</p>

<p>"Don't get excited," Drake shouted back.
"Bushforth met with an accident and the sub
is going to take his place. Come on, Hill." It
was the only thing to do.</p>

<p>Hill saw the eyes of the two seniors brighten
at the news, and heard his own classmates in
the room cursing him. He said to himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
"Now then, I guess I've got to do something
this evening," and followed Drake down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"You're stronger than he is. He's all bluff.
You'll do him dead easily," the two coachers
were saying as heartily as they could. Hill did
not reply. They crossed the light from the entry
door. A strong cheer went up for Bushforth.
Hill laughed. The coachers shivered.</p>

<p>Before they had pushed their way through
the crowd to the ring, word went around that at
the last moment Bushforth was laid off, and
that a big sub named Hill had taken his place.
Few had ever heard the name. The freshmen
groaned; Hill heard it.</p>

<p>As they emerged into the ring, he heard a
strange voice saying, "Why, he's that great
big awkward chap the sophs guy so much, don't
you remember?" Again Hill laughed.</p>

<p>"That's all right," whispered one of the
juniors as he helped him off with his sweater.
"You go in and win this cane, and your class will
give you anything you want. Keep cool now,
and remember what you have learned."</p>

<p>The farmer's big deformity-like shoulders
looked more huge than ever in the thin, white
jersey as he now straightened up in the moonlight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"'Ray! 'Ray! 'Ray! Tiger, Siss, Boom, Ah!
Hill." It rang out sharply on the frosty air.
Then came a long cheer and then more short
ones, with "Hill" on the end of them.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar thrill at the sound of one's
own name shouted by a hundred voices on the
end of a cheer. Hill felt it. He liked the feeling.
"Now that means me," he said to himself,
and he recalled what Drake had said to the
middle weight: "Now remember, your whole
class is watching you." It was in that moment
that Hill caught class spirit.</p>

<p>The heavy weight spree was usually the shortest
and most exciting contest of the evening.
Everyone eagerly pressed forward on the wet
grass.</p>

<p>The sophomores were barking and guying
and quacking exultingly. The freshmen were
cheering hard.</p>

<p>"Get ready, boys," said Jim, the athletic
trainer, acting as referee. He held out the
stick.</p>

<p>The sophomore ran out briskly. Hill spat on
his hands and took his time about it. They
grasped the cane. "Down in front, <i>please</i>!" a
voice pleaded. The cheering had ceased as
suddenly as you turn off the gas.</p>

<p>Hill was cool. He looked about at the theatre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of faces on all sides. Just over the sophomore's
shoulder, down on the ground with moonlight
on his face, he spied an important-looking senior,
with glasses, who on the campus had always
seemed oblivious to the existence of freshmen.
He was rocking back and forth and chewing a
cold cigar to bits.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Hill?"</p>

<p>The freshman spread his legs apart and said,
"Yep."</p>

<p>"Ready, Parker?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A ghastly silent second. "Spree!"</p>

<p>As the referee spoke the word, Hill felt the
sophomore drop. He knew what was coming.
Over his opponent's head he went sprawling on
the grass, as he expected. But just then, in some
manner, quick as a flash, Parker doubled and
threw both legs in between Hill's body and the
cane, and began, with all his strength, to strain,
and push, and wrench.</p>

<p>Hill had expected something, and thought he
was guarding against it. But this was a new
trick&mdash;a variation on the old one&mdash;which the
sophomore had invented himself.</p>

<p>Now, if it had been an ordinary man, with
ordinary Christian shoulders, the strain would
have been too great, and the sophomore would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
have won the cane in ten seconds, as he counted
on doing.</p>

<p>But you see Hill was somewhat deformed as
to his shoulders. He grunted and clung on, and
the sophomore's coachers were yelling fiendishly:
"You've got him, Park! you've got
him!"</p>

<p>The next instant, while the sophomore was
trying to better his advantage, Hill quietly
turned, slipped out of the perilous position, and
drew himself up close to the sophomore's body.
He lay there panting, while his coachers cried,
joyfully: "Good one, Hill! good one!" and his
classmates left off feeling sick at their stomachs,
and began to cheer him by name. This he did
not hear.</p>

<p>He had been taken by surprise at the fall,
but now he was entirely alive to what he was
about. Every nerve was at tension, each muscle
set at hair-trigger. There was just one thing in
all the world to him now, and that was the cane.
And when, a moment later, Parker began a quick
series of furious jerks, back and forth and sidewise,
Hill said, half aloud: "No, you don't, old
man," and smiled confidently to himself as he
felt how firm the cane was in his hand.</p>

<p>The sophomore, on top, now tried working
Hill's hands off with his fingers. But the freshman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
had lived on a farm all his life. Then he
tried something with his legs. But Hill's big
supports were as hard as the columns of Whig
Hall, though not as symmetrical. Then, waiting
awhile, he tried to surprise Hill with more
quick, sharp wrenches. It was unsuccessful. He
waited, and tried it again. Then time was
called. The two class-cheers burst forth simultaneously.</p>

<p>The contestants were dragged to their respective
corners, wrapped with blankets, and sponged
with water.</p>

<p>During the interval, a buzz of voices began
suddenly, as in a racing grand-stand after the
winner has been announced. The college had
expected an easy thing for Parker, the champion,
and when they heard of Bushforth's absence,
they were sure of it. Everyone was saying:
"Who is this Hill? Hasn't he shoulders!
Wasn't that a narrow hole he crawled out of?"</p>

<p>The coachers were whispering, "You're doing
well, Hill. Stick to him, and you'll get him yet.
You'll tire him out."</p>

<p>Two or three freshmen came into the ring and
shook Hill's hand, saying, nervously, "Good boy,
Hill, good one." He was already a distinguished
man, having held the cane for a round
against Parker. But Hill only grinned and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
his own opinion. The honor of the class depended
upon him. He thought he was going to
win the cane.</p>

<p>When the referee called them up, one of the
sophomore's coaches called out, in an easy tone,
"Remember, now," and Parker replied, in a cool
way, "Very well." The silence was worse than
ever. People felt that this would be the last
round.</p>

<p>The two spreers were the coolest on the campus.
But they also felt that this would settle
it, and as they grasped the cane each looked
the other over and then gazed straight into his
enemy's eye. Very much, no doubt, as knights
of old used to size each other up before they fell
to cutting each other to bits, of a quiet afternoon
by the sea-side.</p>

<p>Hill did not like Parker, nor would he have
fancied him even if the sophomore had not been
a brutal and unreasonable hazer. However, he
appreciated his athletic abilities, and even in the
tense moment of waiting for the referee's word,
he could not help admiring the way his opponent's
neck fitted his body, and the clean cut of
his limbs, which Hill himself so lacked.</p>

<p>The sophomore looked him back in the eyes,
and said, sneeringly, "You damned freshman!"
which was entirely uncalled for.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>When the word was given both kept their
feet for a few minutes. They held their arms
down stiff, keeping the cane close to their bodies
in order to prevent the other from jumping in
between. Neither seemed inclined to begin the
attack, and they danced cautiously about the
circle with their faces close together. There was
something impressive in the sight of these two,
pounding about in the moonlight. They were so
ponderous, and it all seemed to mean so much.
Parker tried the right hip throw.</p>

<p>He was partially successful. They were both
on the ground now, and the timer snapped his
stop watch. Time is not counted when the men
are erect.</p>

<p>The sophomore was on top again. Again
he tried his jerking man&oelig;uvres, and again
Hill smiled to himself and thought, "I guess
not."</p>

<p>He lay perfectly still on the wet grass, as if
comfortable and quite content to remain there.
He heard a voice from the crowd say, "Spread
out, you coachers. Give us a show." He could
feel the sophomore's breath on his neck and the
beating of the heart against his back. He felt
the cool wet grass on his cheek flattened against
it, and he became aware that his nose was bleeding,
and then said to himself, "Oh, yes; I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
have bumped that on Parker's elbow when we
came down."</p>

<p>Now, up to this point, the freshman had been
on the defensive entirely, and he had been so
successful that one of the coachers began giving
the signals to begin a little offensive work.
"No, no, Hammie," cried Drake. "Let good
enough alone."</p>

<p>Hill had regained his wind by this time.
"Please don't bother me," he said, in a muffled
tone. "I'm doing this thing. I'll get this cane
in a minute." This was loud enough for some
of those in the crowd to hear. Somehow it
sounded horrible.</p>

<p>And it seemed to enrage Parker. He began
a furious onslaught, as if he were tired of playing
with a freshman so long and meant to end
the thing right there.</p>

<p>He wrenched and jerked this way, he tugged
and pulled that way, he turned over and then
back, he tried all the man&oelig;uvres he knew, and
took desperate chances, which the freshman was
too slow to take advantage of. Twice the
sophomore seemed to have the cane, and the
freshman still held on. It was a battle of giants,
and those that were there will never forget it.</p>

<p>And while they struggled, now one on top and
now the other, they rolled over to the extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
lower part of the circle toward the path leading
to the railway station. That part of the audience
fell back. The ring broke. Some closed in
around them.</p>

<p>Then, while the referee was shouting, "Get
back! Get back!" the freshman was suddenly
seen to rise on his knees yelling shrilly, like a
wild beast in pain. "You would bite me, would
you, you&mdash;&mdash;." He sprang to his feet. The
blood from his nose was smeared all over his
face. A furious wrench jerked Parker from the
ground. With what was extraordinary power
Hill whirled him; part of the way the feet
dragged, though some like to tell that the whole
of Parker was clean in the air all the way round;
he whirled him about, as you would whirl a pillow
with both arms; then, suddenly reversing
all his big weight and simultaneously twisting
the hickory, he snapped the sophomore off in the
air and lifted the cane high and dry above his
head. "The freshman has it," shrieked a shrill
voice.</p>

<p>He felt himself grabbed, he heard many
noises, he went up, up in the air, and then he
forgot.</p>

<p class="p2">The big leather chair was the first thing he
saw, and he knew he was in the Witherspoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
room again. Then he heard many voices talking
at once. He remembered now that he had been
hearing them for ages. They echoed inside his
head some place.</p>

<p>"Are you all right now?"</p>

<p>He raised his lids a little higher and there
was Drake bending over him as tenderly as a
mother.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to know, you great big
awkward old farmer, that you saved the day for
us." Drake looked as delighted as if he had
done it himself.</p>

<p>"I've seen a good many sprees," said another
voice near his head, which Hill had never heard
before, "but that was the finest thing I ever
saw; and I'm blame glad you did him, though I
<i>am</i> a senior and lost twenty-five bats on it."
Hill moved his head and saw the important-looking
senior with glasses.</p>

<p>The farmer now laughed his hideous laugh.
That showed he was all right.</p>

<p>One of the sophomore coachers approached
the bed, and after looking up and down Hill's
bulk a moment, said: "The trouble with you,
you big freshman, is that you don't know when
you're beaten. My man had that cane twice,
but you wouldn't let go."</p>

<p>"Well, that's Princeton spirit, isn't it?" remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the 'Varsity Captain, who had something
to say to Hill later on.</p>

<p>Ramsay, the light weight, came running up
the entry three steps at a time. He had been
leading cheers for Hill out-doors and now he
began hugging him. "Oh, farmer, you're a
dandy. Give me your hand."</p>

<p>But when the farmer raised his hand he found
the cane was still in it. "Here, little one, you
can have this. I've had my fun out of it."
This showed how green he was.</p>

<p>"No," said Ramsay; "you're to keep that forever.
What did you win it for, anyway?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact winning the spree meant
much more to the big placid farmer than a hickory
cane to hang with ribbons over his mantelpiece,
and more than a bit of fame in another
kind of athletics, too. Much more. As we all
know now.

<h2>THE MADNESS OF POLER STACY</h2>

<p>In freshman year they say, "Are you ready to
feed your face?" instead of "Are you going
to dinner?" and at the eating clubs they call
the milk-pitcher the "cow," and shout "Butter
me, please," when they wish the butter handed
to them. All their desires and opinions they express
in variously bold and vulgar metaphors,
which are witty. This is because there is no
one to tell them they must not. The boy is a
college man now. He is free from the restraint
of home or school or both, and he doesn't know
quite what to do with his liberty.</p>

<p>Like a young town horse turned loose for the
first time in the open green of the country, he
sometimes loses his head and frisks and snorts
and kicks up his heels to an unbecoming degree.
This is a way of saying that every once in a
while some little boy (the strictly reared kind,
usually), in his eagerness to show his fellows
how reckless and devilish he is, goes so far that
he never comes quite back. Others dissipate
merely to the extent of cutting chapel twice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
succession or pretending that they have not
poled all night for an examination. In still
others it breaks out in a different form, and they
persuade themselves that they are naughty
cynics or bold, bad agnostics. But that will do
for that.</p>

<p>The point is this: Sooner or later, in some
form or another, this spirit is bound to get hold
of every young man who is worthy of the name,
and, like measles or calf-love, it is better to have
it sooner. In the very young it is interesting.
After that it is not. And the older one is when
it comes, the more he reminds the onlookers of
the frolicksome antics of some ancient, misguided
cow, or of a kittenish summer girl, aged
twenty-eight. When seen in a poler it is pathetic.</p>

<p class="p2">At his first eating club in freshman year, H.
Stacy felt himself snubbed from the start; and
when the crowd, which was not slow, became
well enough acquainted with one another and
with the glorious freedom of college life to pour
syrup down their neighbors' backs and to hurl
fried eggs and coarse jokes about the table, little
Stacy, although he always said, "That was a
pretty good shot," and wiped the potato from
his ear with a noisy laugh, saw that he was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in his own element, which he should have seen
a month before, and got out.</p>

<p>He joined a club of a very different sort of
freshmen, who were too busy speculating upon
their chances at the approaching Divisional
Examinations to invent names for tough beefsteak,
or learn what was going on in Trenton
at the theatres and other places.</p>

<p>This was his element. He drew in long, full
breaths of freedom and sunshine, and told himself
that now he knew what was meant by the
Joy of College Life.</p>

<p>Here he settled down to the methodical poler
habits he was intended for, and when the next
catalogue was issued his mother and sister
pointed out to the minister's wife the name of
"Horatio B. Stacy, New Jersey," in the small
group of names called "First Group," and said,
"We knew he would do it." In his sophomore
year he did it again and won a prize or two besides
and became a minor light in the Cliosophic
Society, and by this time he held in that Hall
an office, the name of which was a secret, and
could not be divulged even to his sister Fannie.
He studied for high marks and was called a
"greasy poler." But he got the high marks.</p>

<p>You must not think he had no friends. He
made some firm ones. About these he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
write home to his sister Fannie, telling what
magnificent characters some of them were.
Often of a Saturday night, if he had no essays to
write or debates to prepare, he slipped off his
eye-shades and pattered across the campus to
his friends' rooms and knocked gently and said,
"How do?" and conversed for an hour on the
difficulty of taking notes when your neighbor
is borrowing your knife, or about the elective
courses for the next term. And down at the
club they had great horse calling each other
"Blamed Neo-Platonists" and "Doggoned
Transcendentalists." Nor was it all shop. One
of them thought himself in love. It was Stacy
that used to wink at the others and bob his
head and say, "I know some one who got a letter
to-day." They had great fun at the club.</p>

<p>By reason of his freshman year's disgust he
remained innocent, which was right, and ignorant,
which was wrong, of much that he might
have experienced, and he bade fair to graduate a
typical poler with a bad breath and an eye on
Commencement stage and special honors. Sometimes,
to be sure, dark questions arose in his
mind, strange, shameful yearnings that caused
him to read whole pages without taking in a word
of it. But then, all polers have wild moments
when they feel that they would rather play on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the team than win the Stinnecke Scholarship, so
Stacy should not have been distressed.</p>

<p>But sometimes it seemed to him that even
those classmates whom he knew only slightly
and did not understand at all, those fellows who
seemed to do nothing but loaf about the campus
all day and sing and shout at night, while he was
running his hands through his hair and his eyes
through Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason," they,
it seemed to him, were getting a poetry out of
college life that he was missing. "But never
mind," he would say to himself. "They will
regret it some day. They will wish they had
done as I am doing, instead of wasting golden
opportunities which come but once and which
glide by like ships upon the sea of life." Then
he would pull his hair and start at the top of the
page again. It is better to have First Group
than the Glee Club.</p>

<p>But there were some fellows who could do
both. Some fellows stood high in the class and
were in with everybody besides. Why could
not he be like that? This question came to him
quite suddenly in junior year, and he tipped his
head to one side and began to think about it.
He kept on thinking.</p>

<p>He was still thinking about it one Sunday
afternoon in chapel when big Jack Stehman, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
tackle, came stalking down the aisles and threw
himself down beside Stacy, and the oak creaked.
He was fresh and clean and rosy from a long
'cross country tramp, and he said, "Hello, Stace,"
in a hearty whisper. It was not from policy
like the smiling hello of a man a few pews in
front, but because he felt like it. Stacy enjoyed
being saluted in that way, and if the big fellow
grabbed and pinched his thin leg he would beam
for the rest of the hour, even though he found a
blue spot there at night when he undressed in
Edwards Hall.</p>

<p>It was because of his way of saying hello, as
much as his great football record, that Stehman
was one of the most popular men in college, and
nobody worshipped him more than did Stacy,
not even the freshman who gazed across the pews
and wondered what it would be like to be on
familiar terms with a man of that sort. Stacy
had at one time feared that there was something
sinful in his own admiration; Stehman was a
fourth-group man.</p>

<p>He was thinking that his big class-mate looked
just as strong and clean and good as during the
season. Just then Timberly, in the pew behind,
lay hold of Stehman's hair, drew his head back
against the rail, and then rubbed his own vigorously
against Stehman's. "Little Jackie's had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
his long locks cut, hasn't he?" he said. His
teeth were gritted and there was a sweet caress
in his Southern voice, for he loved his good pal
Jack Stehman, though he would have called you
profane things if you had accused him of it.
Stehman smiled, and said, "Let go, Timber, you
ass, the organ has stopped."</p>

<p>Little Stacy, watching this out of the corner
of his glasses, said, solemnly, "I'd give my first
group for that," and then bowed his head in
prayer. He thought about it all through the service
instead of listening as he should have done
to a returned missionary who told how many
widows there were in India under thirteen years
of age, and other interesting things.</p>

<p>The next day, when he walked with Stehman
from a lecture by the Dean on Robert Southey,
he tried to catch his friend's tone of hello. Jack
said it to about fifty men between Dickinson
Hall and Reunion, and it sounded as though he
were glad to see everyone of them, and he was.
Stacy liked to be seen with the big fellow. But
he did not blush and keep silent as in sophomore
year when he was first permitted to walk
with him. He tried to show everyone that he
was used to it.</p>

<p>This time something happened. When they
reached the place where the stone walks meet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
in front of South Reunion, Stehman put a big
hand on his shoulder, and said, "Stace, will you
dine with me this evening?&mdash;Oh, yes, you can.
I have an engagement in Dougal's room now. I'll
yell for you on the way to the club. So long."
Stacy opened his mouth and gazed after him
until out of sight. Then he shut it and started
for his room. This was unexpected.</p>

<p>He had often thought about these large swell
clubs with their elective membership, and he
had walked by the houses when the members
were lounging out in front. He had heard
snatches of songs and the click of billiard-balls
from within, and he wondered what they did
and said and how it looked inside. And now he
was going to see one of them, the one he admired
the most of all.</p>

<p>At his own little eating club, he and the others
said that many of the club men were snobs, and
declared that they would have nothing to do
with them. He wondered if his friends envied
them in secret, as he did. At any rate he
would not dread answering them the next morning
when they asked, "Where were you for
dinner?"</p>

<p>When he reached his room he changed his
necktie for a more becoming one. At least he
thought it was. And he put on his new, heavy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
tan shoes, like those Stehman and so many
fellows wore. He would show them that he
knew things. Then he sat down and wrote to
his sister Fannie about it, as he did once before
with a trembling hand, when he won that essay
prize in Hall and came late to dinner in consequence,
and all the fellows cried, "Yea-a, Stacy,
Sophomore essay prize!" He had pointed out
that club to Fannie when she and his mother
came over at Commencement, and he had told
her that Stehman was in that one. She knew
who Stehman was.</p>

<p>Stacy little imagined that he was of so much
consequence, but Stehman, the tackle, had been
talking about him on Sunday evening by the
club fireplace. Two of the fellows who were
younger than juniors ought to be had smiled at
what he said.</p>

<p>To them Jack turned with some heat, and
observed, "You fellows make me tired. You
aren't under-class men now; you're old enough
to know better than to size up people by under-class
man standards. Just because Stacy has
not learned to swear or smoke, and because he
worries and fusses and gets pale over what he
came to college for, you think you have a right
to laugh at him. I respect him, and I wish to
the deuce I was more like him. Little Stacy is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
all right. And he'll be in it all right some of
these days, and he'll do a great deal more good
in the world than most of us."</p>

<p>This was the longest speech Jack Stehman
had ever made, and he was duly applauded and
guyed for it. But he was serious. He had a
Sunday night sour on. It was junior year for
Stehman also, and he too had been coming to
some conclusions about his college course. But
of a different kind.</p>

<p>It was nearly half after six when Stacy heard
his friend's big voice echo across the campus. As
he pattered down the stairs in his stiff, new
Bluchers, he could not help wishing that Stehman
had come a little earlier. Not that he was
hungry, but the campus would then have been
more crowded, while Stehman called, "Hello,
Ray Stace."</p>

<p>As they passed under the lamp-post and Jack
said "Hello" to somebody going in the other
direction, Stacy remembered how that once he
would not have believed that he should ever be
walking as he was now with Stehman's big, strong
arm upon his shoulder, the same arm that had
brought down many a canvas jacket. But that
was long ago.</p>

<p>When they reached the club, Stehman kicked
the mud from his big, heavy shoes on the porch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
steps, and Stacy did the same for his bright new
little ones. The door flew open and the brightly
lighted interior of the club was before them.
Stacy caught a glimpse of an open fire and
deep, comfortable places to lounge in beside it,
and some etchings on the wall. He heard knives
and forks and many voices, all going at once,
and laughter and exclamations. He spied a
waiter hurrying in with a tray full of dishes. A
little nigger boy, with innumerable buttons on
his jacket, began to help him off with his overcoat,
and just then he heard one voice exclaim
emphatically, "Doc., I say they can't do it,"
and he wondered what it was and who could
not do it.</p>

<p>Stehman said, "Come over here a moment&mdash;no,
this way."</p>

<p>"Oh, this way?" said Stacy. He was led to
a large open book with names written on it.</p>

<p>"Will you give us your distinguished signature?"
said Stehman, dipping the pen in ink
and handing it to him.</p>

<p>"Where shall I write&mdash;oh, yes, of course."
Stacy wondered how many people would read
Horatio B. Stacy, introduced by John Carter
Stehman.</p>

<p>Though he had made up his mind to have
confidence he felt a little flustered. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the voices of many diners and the sight of
many rooms and various passage-ways and the
negro buttons were a little too much for him.
Besides his glasses were blurred at coming in
from the cold and that always rattled him.</p>

<p>Possibly his host noticed this, for he said,
"Boo, I'm cold. Let's warm up before grubbing,"
and led him to the fire and pushed him
into a chair big enough to hold two Horatio
B. Stacys.</p>

<p>He was perspiring now, but he held out his
hand to the cheerful blaze as if to get all he
could of it. He looked at the andirons and
the crackling wood and glanced up at the
etchings. He thought, "It must be very fine to
have all this every day."</p>

<p>"Well, do you feel as though you could eat
something?" Stehman lifted him by the coat-collar.</p>

<p>Stacy made answer, in a familiar tone, "I'm
ready any time you are, Jack," and then to
himself, "Keep cool now."</p>

<p>Stehman, with his hands in his pockets, led
the way with his slouching football walk
which the freshmen studied on the way to recitations.
Stacy followed. He slouched pretty
well, but his pockets were at the very top of his
trousers, so that his little coat turned up behind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>They entered the bright, noisy dining-room.
"Jack, why so late?" some one was calling out,
when suddenly there came, "Hello, Stace."
"Hello, Kay." "Hello there, Stace." "How
do do, Stace." Most all of them seemed glad
to see him, and he was quite overcome with answering
them all. Jack showed him where to sit.</p>

<p>After the waiter had pushed the chair under
him and he had unfolded the napkin there
came in a solemn voice from the end of the
table, "Horatio, how do you do this evening?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lint, old man, how are you?" he returned
quickly in a strong tone. Then he
smiled a little because Linton might be guying
him. But he was not.</p>

<p>It seemed that many eyes were upon him and
he felt embarrassed and strangely lonely because
his host had turned to speak about something
to someone on the other side. So he
gave his glasses an unnecessary rub and took
three sips of water in quick succession.</p>

<p>The waiter placed the soup before him, and
while he was occupied with it he had time to
gather himself together. Some of the fellows,
he noticed over his glasses, leaned over or else
slipped way down in their chairs in the same
purposely reckless manner of under-classmen
days. But he held his little shoulders back and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
used his spoon very daintily. He would show
them that he had good table manners.</p>

<p>Stehman now began to chat with him in his
easy familiar way. But the big fellow's manner
always seemed to indicate that he was mindful
of how much higher was Stacy's class rank than
his own.</p>

<p>He was more at ease now, only whenever the
conversation flagged he could never think up
anything to renew it with. He suspected that
he was blushing, and there really was no reason
for blushing. These were all his own dear
classmates, some of whom he knew quite well,
and they all seemed kindly disposed toward him
and included him in their general remarks and
even addressed him sometimes in particular.
He made up his mind that he must say something
to Dougal Davis across the table.</p>

<p>He took a drink of water and wiped his lips
and cleared his throat and spoke. "Dougal,
have you poled up Billy's history for the written
recitation?" Which was the very sort of thing
he meant to avoid. But it was too late now.</p>

<p>"No, but I expect to put a wet towel around
my head and hit it up until three o'clock to-night,"
Dougal answered, sincerely.</p>

<p>And Stacy thought he was joking. He therefore
laughed, saying, "Like fun you are."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>He never could tell when some of these fellows
were in earnest, and Dougal Davis was something
awful to him anyway because he stood
higher in the class than Stacy himself, and yet
had time to be mixed up with half a dozen outside
interests of college life and did a comfortable
amount of loafing besides.</p>

<p>"I suppose you have it all down fine, Stace?"
asked Timberly, agreeably, "and will pound out
a first group as usual."</p>

<p>"Naw," boldly replied Stacy, "I've barely
looked at it. Don't intend to bother with it."
That was the way to talk.</p>

<p>But it was all wasted, for just then Lamason
came in with a suit-case in his hand and his
town clothes on, and everybody was crying
"Yea-a" in loud, shrill tones, and some one began
singing "Oh, to-day is the day that he
comes from the city," and all joined in, even little
Stacy, though he did not know the words and
blushed and closed his mouth again when any
one looked in his direction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lamason, without smiling, or seeming
to be aware of the noise, said, "Bring me
some dinner, Henry, please," and taking a <i>Princetonian</i>
from his pocket began to read an editorial
on the lack of lamp-posts on the south campus,
and paid no more attention to the remarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
about his good-looking clothes than to Timberly,
who was painstakingly mussing up his nicely
brushed hair. It impressed Stacy. Except that
they no longer considered it funny to throw
things or to be profane without necessity, the
fellows seemed to be as free and jolly as in under-classmen
days. He had supposed that there
would be some dignity about a great fine elective
club with white curtains at the window
and a board of governors.</p>

<p>While beginning upon his roast beef the waiter
placed a small, narrow glass by his plate. He
heard the "pop" of a drawn cork behind him.
He had understood that the club constitution
forbade alcoholic beverages. The waiter was
filling his glass. He heard something hiss and
sizzle, but he did not like to look because it
would be so obvious. This would be a good opportunity
to show these fellows that he was not
such a shark as they supposed. Still, after keeping
out of temptation so many years, he did not
like the idea of running the risk of becoming a
drunkard now. But, perhaps, it would not be
wrong to taste a little of it.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of Apollinaris, Ray?" asked
Stehman, emptying his glass at a gulp. "I'm a
disgusting guzzler of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm&mdash;I like it very much," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Stacy. Stehman asked him to have another
piece of roast just to keep him company, and
without giving time for answer, Stacy heard him
say, "Two second, Henry&mdash;rare." Jack made
him drink another bottle of Apollinaris, too,
though it pricked his tongue, and he said he
did not want it, and he felt that he was imposing
upon his friend when he saw him write out
another voucher for the amount.</p>

<p>Most of the table had finished by this time.
They were smoking with their coffee. Those
who could afford it were smoking cigars and
those who had used up their credit with the
Cigar Committee were solacing themselves with
pipes. Some there were who did not smoke at
all.</p>

<p>"Our crowd," Jack explained, "makes it a
matter of principle never to leave the table for
a half hour or so. It's good for the digestion."</p>

<p>Three or four of the fellows were leaning back
with their heads on the backs of chairs or on one
another's shoulders. One was slouching with
his elbow on the table and with his other hand
he played with the salt-cellars. And some
looked perfectly contented and happy, and some
looked grave or sour, and all were beautifully
and completely indolent, and everything seemed
comfortable and happy and Bohemian to Stacy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and he thought it fine to eat his dessert with the
smoke floating about it.</p>

<p>Dougal Davis opposite was blowing fat, well-formed
rings aimed at the top of Stacy's Apollinaris
bottle, while Linton, without looking up,
was informing him, in picturesque, though hardly
complimentary language, that he had a mouth
splendidly adapted to ring-blowing. Davis kept
on sending rings across the table, and paid no
attention. Stacy wondered whether they were
on bad terms with one another. Perhaps it was
rude in him to listen. They seemed so much
in earnest.</p>

<p>It was difficult to understand these fellows.
Some of them he knew to be as hard students as
himself, and yet they seemed to be as much in
with the crowd as the others. Someone would
say something in a most impressive, sober way,
and nobody seemed to notice it, or else everyone
laughed. Of course he knew that what they
were saying during dinner about their extreme
poverty was meant humorously, even by those
of the fellows who tutored or wrote for the
papers to help themselves along. But what
troubled him was that he could not catch the
drift and join in and be like the rest of them.
Once, when everybody laughed heartily, and
Pope bowed his head and said, "I acknowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
that I am sat upon," Stacy laughed, too, and
said "Pretty good," though he did not know
what it was, and hoped that no one knew he was
bluffing.</p>

<p>From another part of the house came the
pounding of billiard-cues and a few emphatic remarks,
varied at intervals with a yell or a loud
laugh. In another room three or four voices
were singing, perhaps unconsciously, and the
strong final notes reached the dining-room. Upstairs
someone was exclaiming, "I had next on
that!" From the lounging room came the notes
of a piano, and Stacy said, "That 'Pilgrim's
Chorus' is a beautiful thing, isn't it, Jack?" for
Stacy knew.</p>

<p>He had enjoyed his dinner, and was perfectly
self-possessed. He could look about the room
at everyone without flinching. Henry brought
the coffee in very pretty cups, with the club design
on them. The buttons came in at Stehman's
ringing. "Jackson, get me a &mdash;&mdash; Ray,
you don't smoke, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do," Stacy replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;bring some Perfectos,
Jackson&mdash;please pardon me, I forgot entirely
that you smoked. I must have mixed you
up with someone else. I thought sure you did
not smoke."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed so cut up about it and his voice
so pathetically apologetic that Stacy felt sorry
for him, and had to say, "That's all right, Jack.
You see I have just begun. That is, I haven't
been smoking very long, you know, on account of
my eyes." But he hoped the others did not hear.</p>

<p>"Will you have a cigarette first?" Stehman
asked.</p>

<p>"No, I prefer a cigar," said Stacy, in a fine,
deep voice. Stehman lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>Horatio had never smoked but one cigar before,
and he was not certain about how much of
the end to bite off. But it seemed to draw all
right when the buttons held a match for him.
It did not make him feel the least bit sick. He
thought he held it between his first and second
fingers rather well.</p>

<p>His host began to talk about the Dean's English
again, and Stacy changed the subject. Of
course Jack meant it out of consideration for
him, but Stacy could talk about other things
than his studies. Presently Jack began again.
"What collateral reading are you doing in the
Public Law course, Ray&mdash;&mdash; What's that
you're saying, Timber?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Timberly, smiling satirically.
"We are just amused a little bit at your
posing as a heavy poler. That's all."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>But Jack only frowned, and turned again to
Stacy, who knew the others were paying attention,
and so made answer, "Don't intend to read
anything. I've quit taking notes on the lectures,
too. A syllabus at the end of the term
will have to do me." That ought to show
them.</p>

<p>Nobody said anything for a moment, and when
he looked up he could not tell from their faces
what they thought of his remark, though Linton
seemed to wear a quizzical smile. But then that
fellow always seemed to be sneering or else looking
oblivious.</p>

<p>Then Smith, who was a track athlete, went
on with his conversation with Pope. He was
venturing the opinion that Princeton's prospects
for the spring were poor. He was a young man
who thought he had a dignity, and he liked to
have people pay attention to what he said. He
had reason to suppose that his opinions on athletics
amounted to something. So he was rather
astonished, as were Stehman and the rest of the
table, when Stacy's high voice burst in with,
"No, now, you don't mean it, Smithie. You are
joking, aren't you?" There was no reason why
he should not be familiar and play horse like
the rest.</p>

<p>At first there was such a pause that he felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
himself blush, and he feared he had offended
Smith, who had stopped talking and was blushing
a little, too. Then suddenly Timberly burst
out with a snorting laugh, and then Davis and
then the whole crowd, even Linton, and Stacy
himself, because he had made such a hit, laughed
modestly, though still blushing, at which they
all laughed still more. He did not know it was
so funny as all that. That was not half as witty
as he could be, as he would show them.</p>

<p>But just then Stehman interrupted and claimed
attention. "Timber," he called down the table,
"I heard a new one to-day on Jimmie McCosh."
Stehman then told a story about the Doctor's
falling on the slippery stones on McCosh walk,
and what he said when he could not get up.
Like most imitations of dear old Jimmie's
Scotch, Stehman's sounded like a poor Irish
brogue. It was not a very good story, but the
fellows imagined how it would sound if told well,
and then laughed because it was good old Jack
Stehman. Stacy thought he could do better
than that.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet. Now was the time.
He cleared his throat. "Say, fellows, this is the
way the president talks in chapel." His voice
was high and unnecessarily loud. He arose and
took hold of the lapels of his little coat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
raised his brows and compressed his lips and
looked side wise through his glasses and repeated
very quickly in a strange voice, "The
seven Arabic numerals do not form a sufficient
basis for crystallization about which the cardinal
virtues may cluster." Then he promptly
sat down and began to puff vigorously upon his
big cigar.</p>

<p>The fellows smiled surprisedly and looked at
each other. Then they laughed. They stopped
a moment; then one by one they began to laugh
again, as if the thing were growing on them.
Finally they roared and kept on roaring.</p>

<p>At home they always applauded when he got
that off, although his mother thought it wrong
in him, but they did not pound on the table and
scream and slap each other on the back, as these
fellows were doing now. It must have been because
this audience was more familiar with the
original. But he hardly heard them.</p>

<p>"Say, fellows, I'll tell you the story of the
little boy who stole the jam!" he exclaimed,
excitedly. Before Stehman and one or two
others of this same crowd he had tried once in
freshman year to tell this same story, and failed
for lack of courage. He was not the least bit
frightened this time.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and imitated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the boy's voice and blew smoke between sentences
and gesticulated with the cigar in his
hand; and when he had finished everyone
pounded and screamed and applauded as before,
while he only shut his lips tight and tried to
look serious, as all good <i>raconteurs</i> should.
Would not this be fine to write to Fannie about?</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" they were shouting to him.
"Give us another, Stace. You're a good one.
Do the Dr. Patton act again. These fellows
haven't seen it."</p>

<p>"No, we haven't seen it. Let her go."</p>

<p>Stacy raised his eyes from the table-cloth.
Those of the juniors that had left and some of
the seniors, hearing the racket, had come in to
see what was up. The piano had ceased. Fellows
were pushing into the room with cues in
their hands and their coats off. Some of them
were sitting on the table. Some had their arms
about one another's shoulders. Leaning against
the door-post, with a pipe in his mouth and a
merry twinkle in his eye, stood a senior named
Bangs, whom Stacy, in freshman year, feared
more than anything on earth. He had never,
until this moment, forgiven him.</p>

<p>Before Bangs and over half the active membership
of the club did little Stacy, who used to
cross the street to avoid being looked at, jump
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
up on a chair and with greater gusto than ever,
with his funny little mouth twisted up, with his
voice strained to produce a peculiar resonance,
repeat part of a sermon once preached by the
president of the college. And when he had finished,
his hearers were doubled up on the floor
with laughter.</p>

<p>Throughout all this Stehman alone seemed
unappreciative. He laughed in a nervous way.
Once he said, "Let's go sit by the fire." Could
it be possible that his good friend Jack, who was
accustomed to being the most popular, was&mdash;no,
he would not think that of him.</p>

<p>"Do something else," they were crying. "Go
on. Go on. Please!"</p>

<p>If he wanted to he could double them up
once more, this time with an imitation of Jimmie
Johnson's stuttering, but he absolutely declined.
He knew that brevity was the soul of wit.
"Stacy, you ought to go on the stage!" one of
the seniors exclaimed.</p>

<p>But he only answered, "Naw. That don't
amount to anything. Shoot." And then they
all began laughing once more at the mere remembrance
of it.</p>

<p>Jack arose to go. Stacy picked up the huge
cigar, which had gone out, and jamming it firmly
between his teeth, strode after his host. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
walked past the fellows, who were still laughing,
as modestly and with as unconscious an expression
as Jack Stehman himself wore on the football
field when running back to his place after
making a touch-down and the crowd was
cheering.</p>

<p>In the hall he said, "I think I'll have to go
now, Jack." His voice was joyously nervous.
He could not hold in much longer.</p>

<p>"Must you go, Ray?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I must finish a letter. Good-night,
Jack, old man. I've had a bully time."</p>

<p>The buttons was helping him on with his
coat, and he repeated, "Good-night, Jack, old
man. I've had a bully time." His voice nearly
broke.</p>

<p>Then the door closed, and Stehman, who was
angry, turned toward the convulsing crowd by
the fire and said, in a calm voice, "I greatly admire
what you fellows have done this evening.
You are indeed typical Princeton men. Oh,
you have the true spirit."</p>

<p>"Fine poler, your quiet, inoffensive, young
friend," some one rejoined with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Not ashamed&mdash;as you were reminding us the
other night&mdash;not ashamed of being a poler
either," said the fellow Stehman had jumped
on for being a kid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>"Wow!" cried Bangs, with a groan of laughter.
"I haven't had so much horse since sophomore
year."</p>

<p>Then Linton spoke. "Jackie, dear, don't look
that way. It's not nice. And do not chew a
rag because your little poler did not develop as
you wanted him to. You must learn to part
with your ideals&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, Jack, you must admit," interrupted
Davis, "that it was absurdly comical. It was
mean to laugh, but how could we help it? His
standing up there and kicking up his poler antics,
like an old cow, and thinking all the time
that he was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was cut short by Stehman's bringing
his big fist down upon a table by the window.
"But, Dougal," he thundered, "that doesn't
make any difference. He was my guest. Because
he tried to bring himself down to our tone
you fellows let him make a fool of himself, and
sat there and laughed at him, like a set of
snobs. Jackson, get my coat."</p>

<p>"You needn't talk so loud," growled a sarcastic-faced
post-graduate. "The people across
the street don't care to hear about it."</p>

<p>"Don't go away with your back up, Jack,"
Linton shouted after him good-naturedly. "And
you need not worry about little Stacy. The best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
time he ever had in college was with us snobs
here to-night, and he's probably chuckling to
himself now on his way across the campus about
the big tear he made."</p>

<p>But little Stacy was not doing anything of
the sort. One of his new Blucher shoes had
come untied when he had jumped up on the
chair to do the president act, and he stopped to
tie it by the light of the club window. And it
was wide open.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<h2>THE HAZING OF VALLIANT</h2>

<p>This story begins with a girl. She was
small and had a nose that turned up and
a quiet appreciation of the ridiculous. All
summer long she sat on the sand without a veil
and was nice to two little boys in clean duck
trousers and buzz-saw hats which blew off
sometimes.</p>

<p>One of these was eighteen years old and
had a complexion that women envied and felt
like kissing. He was small and dainty and
smelt like good soap. His name was Valliant.
The other was a little older, considerably bigger,
and much more self-assertive. Except for
his duck trousers he wore orange and black
with his class numerals on everything. That
might have made but little difference. But
the girl decided that she would like it more if
they would become angry for her sake, which
they one day did.</p>

<p>After that whenever the little one was alone
with her his voice was soft and his manner
thoroughly abject. She liked this. She liked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
his sweet-and-cleanness also. The other, whose
name was Buckley, had an untamed, defiant way
of tossing his shoulders, like an unbroken
stallion. She liked that still more. When she
sat out dances with him, she put him where
the arc-light on the veranda would play upon
his eyes, which were good, and talked about the
other boy's nice manners.</p>

<p>Best of all she liked to have both about
her at once. The sophomore breathed lungfuls
of cigarette smoke and told her how hard his
class would haze the freshman in the fall, and
how cold the canal was on a frosty night,
while the sub-freshman only gazed out over
the legs and arms splashing and gleaming in
the surf, and tried to smile in a way to show
Buckley that he was not taking offence. For
what could a sub-freshman do?</p>

<p>Then the girl would poke the end of her red
parasol in the sand and say: "I think it would
be just too mean of you to haze Mr. Valliant.
He is such a good friend of mine." This
was because it is woman's nature to take the
part of the weak and oppressed.</p>

<p>But one day the sophomore made a remark
about "pretty pink-cheeked boys," which had
been better left unsaid. Then arose the younger
one and shaking impressively a slender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
pink-nailed finger, he spoke. "You had better
not try to haze me, Will Buckley. Do you
hear what I say?" Which was the very worst
thing he could have said. Besides it was decidedly
fresh.</p>

<p>But he was very much in earnest and quite
angry and his young voice broke in the middle.
The sophomore laughed mirthfully and the girl
became genuinely sorry for a moment, despite
the humor of the situation; and as she
watched his dainty legs retreating over the
dunes toward the cottages it repented her of
having stirred up enmity between the two, and
she resolved from that day to make up for it.
This she did by being always good to the little
one in the presence of the big one, which
seems short-sighted in her.</p>

<p>Thus did one small girl amuse herself
throughout the week, and then, when Saturday
evening came and the children were left to burn
cigarettes by themselves, she entertained the
men with it, who came down to spend Sunday.
For her nose turned up and she was good at
mimicry. She won't be mentioned again.</p>

<p class="p2">In the glorious old days of untrammelled class
activity when everyone recognized that there
were certain duties owed the freshman by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
sophomore class, as Hall talk was due them from
the upper-classmen (another good old custom
now defunct), you had only casually to drop
word to a freshman on the way to recitation to
wait for you when night came, back of Witherspoon&mdash;as
you would bid a classmate come to a
spread in your room&mdash;and he would turn up
promptly and smilingly, take his little dose
meekly and cheerfully, and go to bed a better
boy for it and brag about it every time he
dined out in Christmas holidays. But all that
is changed now.</p>

<p>Even in the days of which this is written,
which were only comparatively modern times,
one had to play a very careful game to do any
hazing. The freshman was beginning to hesitate
about putting out his light when you yelled
up at him from the street. People were putting
strange notions in his head. He was beginning
to think he had a personality. They were telling
him he had rights. The old glory had departed
along with Rushes and Midnight Cane
Sprees and Horn Sprees and Fresh Fires to
make room for a University spirit and linen
shirts. At the present rate of retrogression&mdash;mark
the prediction&mdash;it will not be many years
before the freshman will be allowed to wear the
orange and black and the sophomore a silk hat!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
When that day comes, may it be that a certain
Old Grad. will have attended his last reunion.</p>

<p>Twice had Buckley waited near the house
where Valliant ate his dinner. But it's quite
light after dinner in September. He had gone
to the house where he roomed, and asked the
landlady if any of the gentlemen wanted to join
the Y. M. C. A. But that, like the <i>Nassau Lit.</i>
and <i>Princetonian</i> subscription-list-game, had
been played out; the door was closed in his face.
Then for three successive nights he waited in an
alley near by, and on the third night the freshman
came. But with him an upper-classman
friend.</p>

<p>Buckley said things and kept in the shadow.
But the freshman had good eyes and said as he
took out his keys, "Oh, is that you, Mr. Buckley?
Why, how do you do? Aren't you coming
up to see me?" That was horribly fresh.</p>

<p>"Not now," Buckley growled. "Which is
your room?" Excusing himself from the upper-classman,
who was enjoying all this, the freshman
led Buckley into the alley-way, and pointed
up at the wing of the house. It was a large
one and many people lived in it. "That room
up there next to the one with a light in it.
See?" he said in polite, friendly tones. This
was decidedly fresh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>Buckley said he would come up later on in
the evening, which, of course, he had no intention
of doing, and saying "Good-night" good-mannerly
enough, he slinked off, and the freshman
took his friend up the stairs, which smelled
of damp carpets.</p>

<p>The next night Buckley got his gang together.
They blew smoke in one another's faces and decided
that a little exhibition of oarsmanship in
a basin of water with toothpicks would do to
warm up with. Then a cross-country jaunt would
be appropriate, running, walking, and crawling
to the canal. Here, as the freshman was proud
of his shape, he would be given an opportunity
of displaying it while the moon reflected in the
water. And, if he felt cold after that, he could
climb a telephone pole for exercise&mdash;they didn't
want to be inconsiderate of his comfort&mdash;and
sing "Nearer my home to-day, to-day, than I
have been before," at the top of it. Then with
a few recitations and solos on the way back he
could be put to bed. This would be a good
night's work.</p>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock when they carried
the ladder into the alley-way. They laid it
down in silence.</p>

<p>For several reasons this was to be a right
nervy go. A young professor and his young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
wife had a suite of rooms in the house. But it
wasn't that which troubled them. This was.
The moon shone full and strong upon the clear,
blank wall of the house, and it was in plain view
from a certain spot a distance of about two
blocks away. Across this spot a certain owl-eyed
proctor was pretty sure to pass and repass
off and on all night.</p>

<p>That was the reason they were sitting on the
ladder waiting for a signal from Colston, who
was over by the certain spot watching for the
certain proctor.</p>

<p>"Buck, which is the freshman's room?"</p>

<p>"It was the one next to the light and the light
was in the room over the side-door."</p>

<p>"Second or third story?"</p>

<p>"Sist! not so loud. Why, let's see, the third."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Haines, "don't you see the window's
open up there. None of the family would
do that. Town people would never air&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>A whistle came from the silent distance, the
first bar from "Rumski Ho," then a silence, then
the same bar repeated. And by this they knew
that the proctor had walked into the open space
and out of it again, and that if they hurried
they could put the ladder against the house,
send a man up it and take it away again before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the proctor crossed the open space once
more.</p>

<p>Buckley started up. The others leaned
against the bottom round to steady it. Then he
came back for a moment. "Don't take it away
until I get all the way in&mdash;until I wave my
hand. There's plenty of time. Keep cool,"
he whispered, as he nimbly began his ascent.
For his descent he was to rely upon the
stairs, the freshman, and his own persuasive
powers, for what are freshmen and stairs made
for?</p>

<p>Buckley was a right devilish young man, and
typically a sophomore. The year before he had
climbed the belfry of old North and stolen the
bell-clapper and gained class-wide renown. Already
this term he had mounted the water-tower
and painted the freshman numerals green.
The very night before this he had run around the
eaves of Reunion, which is no easy trick, with
"Bill," the night proctor, behind him, and when
he dropped off the bottom round of the fire-escape
into the arms of another proctor, he had
wriggled out again. Still there are sensations
peculiar to scaling a ladder stretching toward
the black of an open window, with a moon
throwing shadows of yourself and the rounds
of the ladder against the dull bricks of an old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
house, while old North strikes two in
the distance. Buckley felt them.</p>

<p>The ladder did not quite reach, and he had to
stand on the top round and stretch for the sill.
Then he pulled himself up, got one foot over,
took a longer grip on the inside of the window,
dragged the other foot up, as you would climb a
high board fence, and was in the room with both
feet. He leaned out and waved his hand. The
top of the ladder silently swung out from the
wall and swooped down in silence. Buckley
turned and started across the room.</p>

<p>He could feel the heavier atmosphere of indoors.
A small clock was ticking somewhere.
He detected a faint scent of mouchoir powder,
and was just remarking to himself half consciously
that it was just like that pretty-faced
freshman, when from somewhere there came a
soft voice, saying, "Is that you, dear?"</p>

<p>Then, before all the blood near his backbone
had time to freeze into little splinters of ice, he
said, "Shsss," and stepped out of the moonlight
and into the shadow, which is the best thing to
do in case you are ever in a similar situation.
Buckley's instinct made him do it.</p>

<p>Across the silence the soft voice floated again
and mingled with the moonlight, "Oh, I'm not
asleep. But why did you stay so long, Guy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
dear?" There was another sound. It was the
squeaking of a bed-spring.</p>

<p>Then, as Buckley's knees stiffened tight
against each other, he spied coming toward him
something white, with two black streaks hanging
half way down, which as the thing came into the
moonlight, he saw to be long braids of dark
hair. Also, the light showed a tall, slender
figure clothed in but one garment, which was
white, and a face which was young and beautiful.
Buckley had never seen a woman dressed
that way before, and he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>But he felt it coming nearer and nearer. He
stood up perfectly straight and rigid in the darkness
as two arms reached up and met about
his neck. The arms were soft, and they smelt
good.</p>

<p>Buckley did not budge, and the soft voice
began, in a sort of whisper, "You have not forgiven
me yet?" It began to sob, and he felt the
sobbing against his orange and black sweater.
"You know I did not mean it. Won't you&mdash;forgive
her? Won't you forgive&mdash;her?" And
Buckley fully realized that he was in the thick
of some romantically ghastly mistake, and that
the only thing he could do to make it worse
would be to speak or show his face.</p>

<p>For fully half a minute he stood thus motionless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
with his arms at his sides, gathering himself
together, and trying to think what to do.
And when he had made up his mind what to do
he gritted his teeth and put both arms about the
Clingy Thing.</p>

<p>And when he had done that the Clingy Thing
began to purr in soft, plaintive tones, which undoubtedly
were sweet, and would probably have
been appreciated by Buckley if he had not been
so rattled. "Tell me that you <i>do</i> forgive me.
Say it with your own lips."</p>

<p>Buckley said nothing with his lips. He was
biting them.</p>

<p>"Guy, speak to me!"</p>

<p>Buckley didn't.</p>

<p>"Speak to me, my husband!" A soft, fragrant
hand came gently up along his cheek, which
tingled, and over his eyes, which quivered, and
pushed back the hair from his brow, which was
wet. Suddenly she raised her head, gave one
look at his face with large, startled eyes, then,
with a shuddering gasp, she recoiled.</p>

<p>But Buckley was not letting go. This is what
he had been preparing for. Keeping one arm
about her waist he threw the other around the
neck in such a way that he could draw it tight if
necessary, and said in one breath, "For heaven's
sake, don't scream&mdash;I can explain!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh! Oh, let go! Who&mdash;let me go or I'll
screa-ch-ch-ch."</p>

<p>But Buckley didn't let her do either. He
pressed on the windpipe, feeling like three or
four kinds of murderers as he did so. Then,
as she struggled with feeble, womanly might,
Buckley did the fastest thinking he had ever
done in all his nineteen years. The door of the
room&mdash;was it locked? The stairs&mdash;where were
they? The front door&mdash;was the night-latch
above the knob? Was it below? Would it
stick? All this time she would be screaming,
and the house was full of men. He would be
caught. He was in for something. But was he
hurting her? He began to talk.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, if you scream it'll only make
things awfully awkward. I got in here by mistake.
I can explain. I'm not going to hurt
you. Oh, please, keep quiet."</p>

<p>She tried again to wrench away from his grasp,
and Buckley drew her back with ease, feeling
half sorry for her poor little strength. "Promise
me you'll not cry out and I'll let go."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I promise," said the scared voice.
"Anything. Only let me go."</p>

<p>Buckley released his grasp. She fled across
the room. He thought she was making for the
door. He sprang toward it to keep her from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
running downstairs and arousing the house.
But she only snatched up an afghan or something
from the sofa, and holding it about her
retreated to the dark part of the room.</p>

<p>Buckley couldn't see her now, but he heard
her moan, "Oh dear, oh dear!" in a muffled tone,
and he felt that she must be cowering in the
corner farthest away from him, and it made
him have all sorts of contempt for himself.
Then he talked again, standing with his back
against the door and looking toward the dark.
"I don't know who you are," he began in a loud,
nervous whisper, "but whoever you are, I wish
you wouldn't cry. Please be calm. I want to
talk to you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear you&mdash;I don't want to
hear you."</p>

<p>"Not so loud, or we'll be heard."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, how can you trade upon my necessity?
Haven't you a grain of manhood, a spark
of kindness in you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, lots," said Buckley. "Listen to
me. Please listen. It's all a big mistake. I
thought I was coming to my own room&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your own room!"</p>

<p>"I mean my classmate's room&mdash;I mean I
thought a freshman roomed here. I wouldn't
have made the mistake for anything in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
world. You aren't half as sorry I got in your
room as I am&mdash;Oh, yes, you are!&mdash;I mean I'm
awfully sorry and wish to apologize, and I hope
you'll forgive me. I didn't mean anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mean anything!"</p>

<p>"Really I didn't. If you'll only let me go
down and promise not to wake the house before
I get out, why, no one will ever know anything
about it, and I'll promise not to do it again. I'm
awfully sorry it happened." Buckley started for
the door.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown&mdash;Mr. Brown, help! murder!"</p>

<p>"Oh, for heaven's sake don't!" cried Buckley.</p>

<p>"I will. Just as soon as I get breath and
strength enough I mean to wake the house, the
neighbors, the whole town if I can."</p>

<p>"No, you won't!" Buckley started across the
room.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried.</p>

<p>He stopped. The voice was commanding. It
seemed already quite strong enough to scream.
He said: "You promised not to scream."</p>

<p>"But you forced me to promise."</p>

<p>"Are you going to scream?"</p>

<p>"I am." She was getting her breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't; please don't. If I wanted to, I
could hurt you. I don't want to hurt you. Ah,
have pity on me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>The bold, bad sophomore was down on his
knees, with his hands clasped toward the dark,
where the voice came from. He was very sorry
for himself.</p>

<p>"You stay right there in the moonlight."</p>

<p>"Right here?"</p>

<p>"Right there. And if you dare to move, I'll
scream with all my might."</p>

<p>Buckley first shivered and then froze as stiff
as if a hair-trigger rifle were pointing at him.
"How long must I stay here?" he asked, without
moving his head.</p>

<p>"Until my hus&mdash; Until daylight," returned
the voice.</p>

<p>"Until daylight!" repeated Buckley. There
was something impressive in the deep, rich voice
of this tall young woman, and whoever she was,
Buckley could tell, from the refined tones, that
she was a lady. He could just make out the
gleam of her face and of one arm in the dark
corner.</p>

<p>Outside, the crickets were scratching in the
warm, still night. It was after two o'clock. A
moon was shining in his left eye. And he, William
Buckley, was kneeling, with his hands
stretched imploringly toward a girl whom he had
never seen before, in the third story of an old-fashioned
Princeton house, which he had entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
for the first time by a ladder which, by
this time, was resting serenely against a freshly
painted house in Mercer Street, whither it had
been borne by four classmates, who were now at
the corner of Canal and Dickinson Streets, as per
agreement, and cursing him for taking such a
long time to pull one small freshman out of bed.
Meanwhile, the moon was approaching the window-post.</p>

<p>"Please, oh, please, whoever you are," he
began, in earnest, pleading tones, "won't you
forgive me, and let me go?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I am a gentleman. Indeed I am! I wouldn't
harm a girl for the world. Please let me go. I'll
be fired&mdash;I mean expelled from college for this.
I'll be disgraced for life. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" The voice seemed to be calm now.
"While it may be true that you did not break
into my room with intent to rob or injure a defenceless
woman, yet, by your own confession,
you came to torment a weaker person. You
wanted to haze one of the freshmen in this
house; that was it. And when my husband&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, have mercy on me. Won't you have
mercy?" Then he began to tell her what a good
boy he had always been, and how he had always
gone to church, and how fond his mother was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
him, and that he was the pride and ambition of
the family, and similar rot, showing how completely
scared to death he was. "Just think
what this means to me," he concluded. "If I'm
fired from college, I'll never come back. I'll be
disgraced for life. All my prospects will be
blighted, my life ruined, and my mother's heart
broken."</p>

<p>She gave a little hysterical sob, as if the
strain were too great for her. "Yes, for your
poor mother's sake; yes, go!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you with all my heart. My
mother would, too, if she could know. I don't
deserve to be treated so well. I shall always
think of you as my merciful benefactress. I
can never forgive myself for causing you pain.
Oh, thank you."</p>

<p>Buckley, the sophomore, who had strode into
that room so manfully, in the full pride of his
sophomorish strength and orange and black,
grovelled across the room and out of the door,
then tip-toed his way down the hall stairs,
silently pulled back the latch of the front door,
and sneaked off, with his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>The outside air did him good, and by the
time he reached his impatient class-mates he had
thought up a fairly good lie about the freshman's
being ill, quite seriously ill, and about his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
stopping to look after him a bit, which they admitted
was the only thing to do under the circumstances,
though it was blamed hard lines,
after all the trouble they had taken. "Better
luck next time, Buck," they said, and went to
bed.</p>

<p>By the ten o'clock mail next morning Buckley
received a letter in strange handwriting. It
said: "Just as a tall woman looks short in a
man's make-up, so does a short man look tall in
a woman's make-up, and you should know that
blondes are hard to recognize in brunette wigs.
I could have done more artistic acting if you had
come up earlier, when I had on my full costume.
You ought to know that a real girl wouldn't
have behaved quite that way. You see you still
have a number of things to learn, even though
you are a soph. Sort of hard luck, all this,
isn't it, old man? Hoping that the rouge will
wash off your lips and that you will learn to forgive
yourself, I am your merciful benefactress,
H. G. Valliant."</p>

<p>This is the freshest thing I ever heard of.</p>

<p>There was a P. S. which said: "Whether or
not this thing gets out rests entirely with you
and your hazing friends."</p>

<p>Of course it did get out, as all such things
do; but Valliant was not bothered again by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
sophomores, though he ought to have been
hazed up and down and inside-out and cross-wise
by the whole college.</p>

<p>You can see him if you attend the next production
of the Dramatic Association.

<h2>HERO WORSHIP</h2>

<p>Near Old Chapel he used to linger on the
way from recitations, buying things from
old black Jimmie and pretending to be amused
by his stuttering conversation while he watched
the passers-by. And when The One came along
for whom he waited, he said to himself, "Oh,
he's wearing his brown shooting-coat to-day,"
and turned and gazed after him until out of
sight, wondering what lecture he had at that
hour and how he would get along at it. Then
passing on slowly across the campus he turned
out upon the street.</p>

<p>When he reached his room, Darnell said to
another freshman that lived in the house, "I
saw Lawrence to-day. He was walking with
his arm around Nolan. He passed right by
me." And he could also have told just how he
nodded to the fellows along the walk and how he
swung his legs. Darnell thought that Lawrence's
gait was just right. So was his manner
of dressing. Somehow Darnell could not make
his corduroy coat hang in that way. It lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
back all right, but it would not stay snugly up
on his shoulders as Lawrence's did.</p>

<p>He used to see him quite often now, for by
this time he had learned at what hours Lawrence's
lectures came. Which was more than the
senior himself knew, for he had always to look
at the schedule tacked up on the back of the
door over the faculty and absence committee
summonses.</p>

<p>Darnell remembered the first time he saw
Lawrence. It was on the morning of the first
day of the term, while he was sitting in the office
of the old Nassau Hotel, quietly waiting for
his mother and trying not to appear green and
thinking that everyone who came in was a sophomore
and wanted him. It was raining, he remembered,
and people came scurrying in with
their trousers turned up and mackintoshes on.
Lawrence came in alone.</p>

<p>He came with his impressive stride and a very
long paddock coat and a new kind of shooting-cap
which he brought back with him from Piccadilly
the first of the month. He frowned and
glanced about the room. And when he found
the two faces he was looking for and strode
across to where a worried-faced gentleman in a
silk hat was reading the paper beside a freshman
with a grinning face, he said, holding out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
his hand, "So you have arrived." It was just
the patrician tone of voice that Darnell had expected
when he saw the face.</p>

<p>When Lawrence stretched out his hand his
long coat fell open and disclosed an orange monogram
of many closely intertwined letters shining
against the black of his undercoat. It was
worked upon the breast-pocket, and the freshman
wondered what that mysterious insignia
might mean.</p>

<p>He watched him as he jerked his head and
blew smoke in the damp air. The way he
tossed the ashes away was perfect. And when
Lawrence suddenly turned and, looking frankly
in the freshman's father's eyes, said with a reserved
smile, "You need not worry about that,
Mr. Jansen," and stretched an arm about the
freshman's shoulder, Darnell thought he would
rather be that freshman than anyone in the
world&mdash;except the owner of the arm.</p>

<p>Then he began to speak again, and Darnell
found himself leaning forward a little. He remembered
thinking, "I don't care if it is impolite
to listen."</p>

<p>Lawrence said in a rapid manner, without
opening his teeth very wide, "The team? We
brought them down from the island last evening.
Sea air is a good tonic to begin a season's training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
with, and they are all in excellent shape.
Billy, you must bring your father down to the
field to see my big brown babies." Darnell remembered
every word, though he did not understand
quite what it meant at the time.</p>

<p>Soon after getting settled he took pains to
pick up an acquaintance with this freshman.
That was the time he first found out that the
senior was one of the Lawrences. The freshman
said, "Yes, he's a mighty fine fellow. He played
on his class eleven in his freshman year." But
that was all Jansen said. He did not enthuse
as he should have. He had no more than the
ordinary fear and reverence of a freshman for a
senior. There was a man on the team named
Stehman. He was the one this freshman turned
and gazed after on the campus.</p>

<p>But now Darnell knew more about him than
Jansen did. From the last year's "Bric-a-brac"
he had learned the senior's club and what committees
he was on, and the book opened up now,
of its own accord, to the picture of the Glee
Club. He could have told you Lawrence's middle
name and his street and number at home,
and his campus address as well. Whenever the
freshman went to night session of Hall he looked
up as he went by to see if the room in West
were lighted, and he wondered what he was doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
up there behind those curtains. Once, while
passing by, some one was calling "Hello-o-o,
Harry Lawrence!" and in Lawrence's own voice
came a muffled "Hello! Come up." It did not
seem quite right for them to be noisy and familiar
with Lawrence as with ordinary fellows. He
did not understand how Lawrence allowed it.</p>

<p class="p2">In Jansen's room it was, and Old North was
ringing curfew, when Lawrence shook his hand
and said in his peculiar throaty voice, "Glad to
know you," or else "Glad to meet you." He
never could be certain which it was. It was on a
Tuesday evening, and he had made a poor recitation
in algebra that day. He noticed that Lawrence
was only about an inch taller than himself.</p>

<p>Darnell looked straight back at him and said,
"I think I have heard my sister speak of you,
Mr. Lawrence. She met you down here at the
sophomore reception last June." His voice was
perfectly firm and strong, but his mouth persisted
in drooping a little at the corners. He
could not help that.</p>

<p>Lawrence said, "Yes, I remember very well,"
which delighted the freshman's sister Louise,
when Darnell wrote to her about it, just as much
as if it had been true. "Is your sister coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
down to any of the dances this year?" added
the senior.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe she is. My aunt brought
a whole crowd down that time. Mamma was on
the other side, or she would not have allowed it.
Louise is not out yet." Then he dropped his
big brown eyes and blushed because he felt that
he was talking too much and because he had
said "mamma" before the senior.</p>

<p>But Lawrence was only looking grave and
interested and well-bred, and he replied, "I see.
That's too bad. I wish she could come."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Darnell, "I wish she could come,"
and then, although he did not want to, he arose
to go, because he thought that Lawrence wished
to talk confidentially with his freshman, Jansen.</p>

<p>Lawrence, who did not care about his going,
because he found it as easy to talk to two freshmen
as to one, said, "I hope I'm not driving
you out, Bonnell. Good-night. If your sister
should decide to come down this year, don't
forget to let me have a chance at her card before
it's filled. Good-night, Bonnell."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't," said the freshman. "Good-night."</p>

<p>As if he could forget. As if he would be
allowed to forget, indeed! She, dear little
thing, in her own becoming little way, worshipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
him, too. And at Mrs. Somebody's
School in Somethingtieth Street, she used to slip
an arm about the waist of her latest everlasting
friend, and whisper something about it on the
way upstairs after prayers.</p>

<p>During her evening's acquaintance with him in
June she had told the great, dark, wonderful
man that had "a whole tragedy in his face,"
"a certain indefinable something" in his manner,
and many other things, too, no doubt, that
she had a brother who was coming to college the
next fall, and she asked Lawrence in a very
timid, pretty, natural manner if he would please
look out for her brother, who would be a freshman
and only sixteen years old. And Lawrence,
who was watching the way she held her head
and approving of it, said, "Of course I will,"
and forgot about it during the next dance, which
was with a Newark girl, who asked him how the
Sunday night hot-liquor club was prospering.
That was last June.</p>

<p>To be sure Lawrence did not get his name
just right, but then many people did not come
that near when they first heard it. Besides,
what of that? Had he not looked at him and
addressed him twice? That was more than
most freshmen could say.</p>

<p>But it hurt a little the next day, when Darnell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
changed his mind about going to the library because
he saw that if he kept on up the walk he
would meet Lawrence coming toward Dickinson's
with three other seniors. For he received
only an absent-minded glance without the movement
of an eyelash. But you could not expect
Lawrence to remember all the people he met.
And, perhaps, he was worshipped all the more
for it.</p>

<p>On Sunday he used to gaze with his big
brown eyes from his seat in the freshman section
way over through the juniors and past
some of the seniors, back to Lawrence's place.
Sometimes a big head of football hair was in
the way, so that he could not tell whether he was
there. He was absent so frequently. But when
they all arose to sing the first hymn, then he
could see, and then he would recall what the
football column in the paper he had been reading
before chapel reported that "President
Lawrence" had done or said, and he wondered
whether he himself had read it and how it felt
to see one's own words in type.</p>

<p>He seldom joined in the singing, Darnell
noticed, unless it was "Ein Feste Burg" or
"Lead, Kindly Light," and though he could not
tell why, Darnell admired him all the more for
his not singing every time. At any rate, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
just like him to stand there with his hands in
his pockets and his aristocratic head thrown
back and look dark and grave and mysterious.
He always looked especially so, Darnell thought,
in chapel. His mien seemed to be haughty and
kingly, not merely dignified and exclusive like
that of many upper-classmen. Lawrence when
a freshman could never have been hazed or
guyed. He could not imagine him stooping to
haze anyone either.</p>

<p>Lawrence could do anything. Anyone could see
that from his eyes and chin and the straight,
firm mouth with the thin lips. Darnell knew
very well that Lawrence could stand high in his
class if he wanted to. Probably he could play
football. He was built well enough. Darnell
thought it would not be quite Lawrence's style
to play football. He would hate to see him
tackled or rolling in the mud. That would never
do for him. Lawrence, he thought, would not
have played on the team if he were asked. Darnell
had been a Princeton man less than a month.</p>

<p>But he had what was far better than playing
on the team&mdash;the management of it. And he was
just right as he was. He was a dignified, weighty
senior, respected by all and feared by many, no
doubt, and a man, not a boy, who had travelled
much and lived much and had had all sorts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
experiences in his younger days. He was old
now, nearly twenty-two.</p>

<p>But the most wonderful thing about him was
his composure and his commanding reserve.
He had the look of the gentleman. His manner
seemed altogether impervious to excitement. He
was master of every situation. To have such a
man in their classes must have been rather embarrassing
to the professors. Darnell supposed
that the other Lawrences were rather afraid of
him when he came home.</p>

<p>His perfect command of himself and of everyone
and of everything about him was what most
impressed the freshman. That was the reason
that when his idol fell, it jarred him.</p>

<p class="p2">On Thanksgiving evening his head was throbbing
and his ears ringing with the echo of
horns and cheers, and before his eyes were flashing
little kodak recollections of how the line
looked when the ball was put in play, and how
the crowd waved and yelled when the full-back
tried for a goal. But there was a lot of aunts
and cousins and things-in-law for dinner, whom
he had to kiss and smile at when they said,
"How you have grown!" He wanted to get
near some class-mate and put his arm about
him and talk it all over, like any other healthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
young man after the game. And, as early as
he decently could, he slipped on his big new
coat and stole out by the basement door.</p>

<p>He walked down the avenue to Madison
Square, getting jostled and excited once more.
Noisy gangs of fours and eights and dozens
were marching and dancing along the street.
Some wore orange, others blue. Some were
students at various colleges, most of them had
never seen one.</p>

<p>He went into the Hoffman. Closely packed
streams of men were crowding in and out. The
air was hot and there was a confused din of many
voices. He worked his way to the end of the
glaring room, but saw none of his intimates and
but few fellows that he had ever seen before.
Most of the crowd were of the sort he had seen
on the street, young men of the town with college
ribbons all over them, and such boisterous
noises grated on him, so he started out again.
Some hoarse cheering and husky laughter made
him turn and look toward the corner where the
throng was thickest. Then he hurriedly pushed
his way through the crowd to gain a nearer view
of what he saw upon the table.</p>

<p>He tried to persuade himself that it was
someone else. He did not understand how he
could be among people of this sort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>But there was no mistaking that mouth,
though he had never seen the hair hanging down
that way, nor the eyes as they were now. About
the neck was the rim of a hat.</p>

<p>Suddenly two other fellows brushed past
Darnell. He looked up and thought he remembered
having seen their faces on the campus.
They seemed to be excited, and they wedged
their way roughly through the crowd to the table.
"Leave him alone," one of them was calling out
above the din. Brushing aside some slight interference,
they picked up the heap from the
table, half carried it through the crowd, saying,
as they went along, "You're all right, Harry.
Brace up, Harry, you're all right," and paying
no attention to the crowd, they hurried across
the room to the Twenty-fourth Street entrance
and disappeared.</p>

<p>For a moment the freshman only stared at a
long, tall clock and wondered. Then he suddenly
turned and hurried out into the street.</p>

<p>It was no affair of his. The others were there.
They were the ones to take care of him. But
the electric light had given him one glimpse, and
for the moment it was very revolting. He turned
and walked slowly home.</p>

<p>He tried to reason himself out of it. It was
nothing to feel so queer over. It was not such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
a terrible thing, after all, especially after having
the game turn out as it did. Most every
young man was indiscreet at some time or
other. Lawrence was a young man like many
others, only he happened to have been indiscreet
under unfortunate circumstances. That was all.
It seemed worse than it really was.</p>

<p>But he did not want Lawrence to be like
others. That was just the point. If it had
been someone else he would not have cared.
But for Harry Lawrence, Lawrence the superb,
his Lawrence, there in that glaring place&mdash;jeered
at and made a fool of&mdash;by that mob of
muckers. It was all wrong.</p>

<p>"Well," he said to himself, as he went upstairs
to his room, "I suppose I'm too much
of a kid, and I'll have to get over my kid ways
of looking at things. The sooner the better."</p>

<p>But all the same, it hurt, and when he was
dropping off to sleep, he was startled into wakefulness
again by one of those queer, sudden
pangs which make one ask, "What is it I've
lost?"

<h2>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
LAWRENCE</h2>

<p class="center p2">I</p>

<p>Many fellows seem to think that all an athletic
officer has to do is to look important
and travel about the United States with his
team and make out a bill for expenses.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to carry a japanned tin box,
and sell tickets through a hole where the wind
blows, as treasurer. As president it is a fine
thing to make frequent trips to New York, and
attend conclaves that are secret, and make
speeches in conventions and read your opinions
next morning in the paper in fine long sentences
prefixed with "President So-and-so said last
night," and to be lunched by famous authorities
and interviewed by rapacious reporters who
think that because the public supports football
they have a right to see all the inside workings
of intercollegiate diplomacy. All this is the
pretty part of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>But like all greatness there is a deal of hard
hustling and perspiration and discouragement
and annoyance underneath. So much so, that
one seldom has time to tell himself how fine a
thing it is to wear a 'varsity blazer with the
orange monogram on the breast-pocket. And
this is usually heavy with bills to pay and memoranda
of things to see to. Besides, the responsibility
is tremendous.</p>

<p class="p2">H. Lawrence, Ninety Blank, had blood-shot
eyes this morning, and he hurried down the clattering
iron stairs of West College tying his neck-tie.
As the ugly entry door slammed behind
him he did not put his hands in his pockets and
begin to whistle, as he used to do in under-classman
days, because he was not sauntering
over to Reunion to smoke a pipe, or down to
Witherspoon to loaf until the next lecture. He
glanced at the clock in old North tower and hit
up his pace.</p>

<p>He had given orders to the team to be at the
station with their grips packed at 9.38, and before
that time he had to wire a member of the
Graduate Advisory Committee, asking where
he could find him that evening, and to an official
of the Manhattan Athletic Club that he
should not be able to consider his proposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
at present, and to the manager of a Southern
college football team that he regretted that all
Princeton's open dates were now filled, and to
the Jersey City Station restaurant to prepare a
luncheon of training food for twenty men, and
not to roast the beef to death this time. After
that he would have to call upon the dean and
find out whether the faculty had decided to let
Harrison play football or not, and find and be
nice to another member of the faculty who was
indignant because seventeen grand stand tickets
had not been saved for him and his wife's relatives
at the last Saturday's game, and then hurry
to the station by way of the bank, where he
would ask if they had heard anything more
about that protested check, while he was making
a good one out for himself, and then see to
it that all the team and subs were flocked together
and pushed into the train and made to
stay there until told to get out and play football.
Some of which would have been more
properly the duties of Sinclair, the treasurer,
who was not catching on as rapidly as Lawrence
thought he should.</p>

<p>He took long, strong strides and looked
straight ahead of him, which was in the direction
of an old shop opposite the gate, with a picturesquely
warped roof which he did not see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>He did not see the fellows along the walk
either, and those he did not cut he nodded to
absently without removing his frown. This
caused certain passers-by to shake their heads
and say, "Harry Lawrence is getting a swelled
head since he's become so important," especially
those who greatly wanted to be important themselves
but weren't, and so had plenty of time
to criticise those who were.</p>

<p>But Lawrence, with a half dozen unopened
letters in his pocket which he would read on
the train going up, did not dream of being criticised.
And if he had he would not have felt
very badly about it. He did not have time.</p>

<p>Nor would he have had time to stop and
thank his good friends Nolan and Linton, who,
when Lawrence had rushed by with one of
those "How-do's" which make one think that
one's name has been forgotten, had looked
worried and then said, "Harry'll kill himself before
the end of the season," while Lawrence
tore open a telegram with which the boy met
him in front of College Offices and hurried on.
He had no time for breakfast, because the man
had forgotten to wake him, and the night before
he had been handling the files of applications
for the Thanksgiving game seats with Sinclair
and dictating to a stenographer until 2 <span class="s08">A.M.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>Every evening from eight until midnight
there was a reception in his room, with Sinclair
to help receive. It began when they came in
from the club after dinner, with a workman or
two from the town waiting in the entry, who
touched their hats and said, "Please, sir, Mr.
McMaster says this bill is correct." Then would
come members of the team who wanted the
management to remove conditions for them, and
coachers who wanted to talk serious business
and had but a short time to spare, and some of
the fellows who wanted to smoke and chat and
seemed hurt when told to get out; and in addition,
the hordes of applicants for seats, who kept
running in and out, incessantly buzzing in the
management's ears like flies, and just as pestiferously
merciless, from eight until twelve, when
the door was locked.</p>

<p>These represented all phases of college life,
from the professor who "never incurred any
difficulty in getting all the seats he wanted in
previous years" to the young freshman whose
mother knew the management's mother, and
thought he might be especially considered for
that reason, and including class-mates who made
it a personal matter of friendship, and thought
they ought to be considered ahead of mere
strangers for that reason. Also emissaries from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
a certain woman's college, who must have tickets
before they are put on sale, because the
poor, timid girls could not stand in line with all
those men, and cousins of members of the team,
and many others, all of whom furnished an excellent
reason for being entitled to just a little
more consideration than anyone else. None of
which counted them anything in Lawrence's
reign.</p>

<p>But this was not what made Lawrence scowl
and look fierce as he hurried by a little, wistful-eyed
freshman, whom he did not see, and
who had been hoping all the way from the
First Church gate to the dean's that maybe this
time the senior would recognize him. Lawrence
was used to all this, and he liked it. He
liked having a lot of things to attend to in a
short time, to see many people and give orders
and talk fast and feel his brain warm with
quick thinking. He enjoyed responsibility, and
he thought it was thrilling to get in a situation
and then take a long breath, so to speak, and
command it. Nor was he too old to fully appreciate
his privilege of being on intimate terms
with ancient heroes of the football field, and he
was glad to be thrown with so many other
prominent alumni. And he took great satisfaction
in watching the long-headed Advisory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
men begin to acknowledge by their attitude
that although an undergraduate he had reliable
executive ability and somewhat of independent
resource besides. One of them clapped him on
the back one day and said, "Good! That's the
proposition we'll make 'em," and added, "You
are your father's own son, Lawrence."</p>

<p>Except that he would have liked to have a
little time to loaf and enjoy life, he was quite
well pleased with being president of the
P. U. F. B. A., and did not care a rap whether
the college considered him arrogant or not.
He was attending to his own business and had
the satisfaction of knowing that he was doing
it rather well, with the attendant satisfaction of
having had the honorable position given him by
the vote of the college body without his or his
friends' boot-licking one of them for it. And
that is one of the most satisfactory feelings in
the world.</p>

<p>The thing that troubled him was a letter in
his pocket. That was the reason that when the
ninth old grad. approached him on the field
and said, "Say, Lawrence, just between us now,
what do you think of the chances with Yale?"
he replied, curtly, "How do I know?" and
hurried on up the side lines. This was decidedly
fresh, and he jumped on himself afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
because he did not believe in letting private
affairs interfere with business. Usually
he could stand a dozen old graduates.</p>

<p>The letter had come the day before. It was
from his father and enclosed Lawrence's November
allowance. He never received but one
letter a month from the governor, and it nearly
always contained two statements: "Enclosed
please find ..." and "Your mother and all
are well," both of which make very agreeable
reading.</p>

<p>This time the letter was not dictated, but
written in the Colonel's own small, straight
hand, and there was an extra paragraph. It
ran thus: "Had I known what this official position
of yours involved, the amount of time,
the number and variety of interruptions, and the
vulgar prominence that your name and movements
occupy in the press, I should never have
given my consent, which, as you may remember,
I did reluctantly, to your acceptance of it. In
my opinion what you are learning at college
could better be acquired at home: a little of
business down-town with me, your <i>other accomplishments</i>
up-town in the clubs and other
places with your friends." This was not the
sort of letter to do any good.</p>

<p>"'Your other accomplishments'&mdash;now what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the devil does he mean by that, I wonder?"
thought Lawrence. And then he folded the
letter and tossed it into a pigeon-hole marked
"Unanswered," and turned his attention upon
a large blue-print marked "Stand B" and tried
to assure himself that the reason his mind kept
jumping back to pigeon-hole "Unanswered"
was because he was sorry at being too busy to
study, and disliked having such a low stand in
class. But it wasn't his class standing that
kept him awake until old North struck five.</p>

<p>After this when in New York he did not go
up-town to dine with the family as often as
formerly. When he did his father merely
said, "Judge Hitchcock told me he saw you on
Broadway last Wednesday," and similar remarks
in a casual tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Harry would reply, with his attention
on the crest on his plate.</p>

<p>Then each would wonder what the other
meant, until Helen would interrupt with, "By
the way, I saw by the <i>Tribune</i> this morning
that 'President Lawrence of Princeton' says
that Yale will beat Harvard at Springfield. So
it's all right then, Winston." He was her husband,
Yale '86, and Helen was a good sister,
who had a large intuition and knew things.</p>

<p>On Thanksgiving Day the College of New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Jersey went up to New York feeling quite certain
of winning the game. The alumni said we
would win. The heelers doubled their bets.
The coachers were sure we'd win. Most of the
authorities conceded the victory to Princeton.
The team were confident of winning. Yale won.</p>

<p>During the dinner after the game, Lawrence
was dignified and silent. People thought he
was rattled, if anyone thought about anything
else than the one big, sad fact. He presided
gracefully though. He was very good to look
at. The dinner, which is usually very long, was
wound up early, few being unwilling, and Lawrence
helped put one of the blubbering backs to
bed who had taken too much for a training
stomach and head. Then he went downstairs,
saying, "Now, then, my responsibility is over
with. I am going to have a good time."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">II</p>

<p>He had done it hard because he did everything
hard. It had lasted several days
and ended in a hospital in West Philadelphia,
where he had three stitches put in his forehead.
Now he was back in his old room in West
College, with a pipe in his mouth, drumming
on the arms of his chair and staring straight at
his feet, which were upon the roller-top desk.
Dark rings were under his eyes and he told
himself that he had had a good time.</p>

<p>He was thinking that it was quite a storybook
coincidence that they should have come
together, those two letters. They were so different
and yet so much the complement of each
other.</p>

<p>The first was from his father. He had torn it
open with his pen, as he would any other letter,
and though he saw that it was several pages in
length and knew intuitively that it would not be
like any other letter he had ever read, he had deliberately
rolled up the envelope to get a light
for his pipe from the fire, and he had stretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
out in the chair again as he was before, with his
legs sprawled out in front and elbows resting on
the arms, holding the letter before his face.</p>

<p>Then he had commenced to smoke very hard,
and presently stopped rocking back and forth
as he read the words written in that clear, even
hand, without a flourish or a superfluous mark,
words that had caused him to gnaw the mouth-piece
of his pipe as they burned their way into
him. And all the while he pictured to himself
a tall figure in a smoking-jacket trimmed with
white braid sitting up straight and rigid at his
desk in the corner of the cosey inner room of
the office in William Street, and recalled how
once, when an absconding clerk had left a temporary
cloud on the name of the firm, the old,
steely eyes had flashed under the lowering brows
as the old gentleman had taken his seat at the
breakfast-table, where he ate nothing.</p>

<p>The letter sounded very like the governor.
There was no mistaking its meaning. It was a
succinct and comprehensive report of dissatisfaction
at the younger Lawrence's methods, with
a list of debts of filial affection and memoranda
of overdraws on parental patience covering the
last three years, and accompanied by a brief
prospectus for the unpromising future. It was
the sort of a letter he would have fancied a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
stately old gentleman like his father that was
proud of his name writing to a son like himself
that had disgraced it.</p>

<p>Only it would have been just as well, Lawrence
thought, to have omitted that part of the
letter. He was quite willing to admit most of
the hard things his father said of him because
they were facts, but this about dishonorable
cowardice and the family name was going a little
too far, and he told himself that he did not
quite see how he could stand that from anyone.
And he sat up straight and pressed hard on the
arms of his chair and looked very like the indignant
old Colonel who had written the words.</p>

<p>It was uncalled for, it was unjust, it was ridiculous.
If his father would stop to think of
things as they really were in this world, thought
Lawrence, Ninety Blank, these little shortcomings
of his would not appear a bit worse than
those of some of the very same young men in
town whose industry and clean business ability
the Colonel so much admired, and whom he
spoke of as the hope or flower or something of
Manhattan's commercial supremacy or something.</p>

<p>It was merely that he happened to be indiscreet
the last time he was having a good time.
He had made a little too much noise, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
echo had reached a number of people in town.
That was all. It was hard luck, but it did not
amount to enough to become dramatic over.
Merely because his great-grandfather did something
and his grandfather was something was
no reason, as far as he could see, why the
Lawrences should have unique moral standards.
The governor was certainly getting old.</p>

<p>Then he had carefully arranged the leaves
of the letter in order, mechanically folded and
put them in a pigeon-hole of the desk, and
opened and spread out the other letter before
him. But he did so unconsciously, for he was
staring straight out ahead of him into the face
of the future, which had expressionless features.
His father had concluded with "Signify to me
at once your intention of a complete change in
your career, or, notwithstanding your nearness
to graduation, I shall take you out of college
and put you at work in Van Brunt's." That
is not the way a boy likes to be written to.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't think I'd do all that if I
were you." He could not abide his father's
tone when he spoke of <i>taking</i> him out of college
or <i>putting</i> him at work, or doing anything with
him. He was still young enough not to fancy
being considered young.</p>

<p>And then the actuality of the situation occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
to him, and he was reminded that although
twenty-one he had not a cent of his own,
and that there was no place in the world to go
to or a thing that he could do to make money
enough to even pay his debts.</p>

<p>"Picture of a young man taken out of college
because he is bad." He smiled broadly at himself
in the glass over the mantelpiece. But it
wasn't very funny.</p>

<p>And it was at this point that he dropped his
eyes to read his father's words once more, and
was startled for an instant to see a strange handwriting,
and then remembered the other letter.
He was again startled by the first words that
met his glance. "Haven't you had enough of
college?" At the top of the paper was the
name of a La Salle Street, Chicago, firm. It
was not so very queer after all. It was only
that it was so startlingly apropos. He read the
letter in eager gulps. Then he read it again.</p>

<p>It was from his friend Clark, who had been
so kind to him when he was out there. And
now he was still more kind. It was singular
that the offer should come just now, on that
very day, at that very hour. He would wire
back his acceptance that afternoon. "Now, of
course, it is too bad to make you stop in the
middle of your last year," the letter ran, "but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
we can't hold it open after the first of January.
I know what a big concession you consider it
for a New Yorker to come to Chicago, but you
know better than to be prejudiced. You know
the crowd you'll blow with and the clubs you'll
be in, and as the situation is something extraordinary
to be offered to so young a man,
I hope you'll wire me your acceptance at once.
The mature judgment you showed in conducting...."
These words came to his heated
brain like a cool lake-breeze. This was what
he wanted more than anything else in the world
just now, to get away from his present surroundings,
and to start anew, where he would
be his own master, making his own money and
disposing of it as it suited him, and responsible
to no one for the use he made of it or his time.
He wanted to be free.</p>

<p>The bell in Old North broke in on him. He
looked at the clock on the mantelpiece, and was
surprised to see that it was only four, and that
it must have been but a half hour since he received
those two letters. Then he remembered
that he had a lecture at that hour. It made
him smile to think of it.</p>

<p>But, it occurred to him, it would be a right
good idea to go&mdash;he would be going to few
enough more&mdash;anything to get out of the close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
atmosphere of the room and interrupt the current
of his thought. For his thoughts were
chasing each other about in a circle, and they
would not stop, although he pressed his forehead
with both hands, as he used to do during
the football season. Lately his brain had taken
to behaving in a very queer manner, and a
fellow he knew at the College of Physicians and
Surgeons had told him that if he did not stop
worrying about things he would have neurasthenia
or something as ugly sounding as that.</p>

<p>As he opened the entry door and stepped out
into the open air of the campus, the old bell began
throbbing, clear and strong, in his ears.
It somehow recalled freshman year and how
he used to run to reach his seat before it
stopped ringing.</p>

<p>He was in the crowded quadrangle now, with
fellows all about him with books or note-books
under their arms, whistling and singing and hallooing
and scraping their feet along the walks
just as they had always done. Over in front
of Reunion was the usual crowd kicking football
and squabbling over their points. The
side over by College Offices was shouting exultingly
"Nine to seven!" and a fellow on
the side near by was announcing with equal
conviction, as he turned the ball over in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
hands to punt, "Eight to seven." Lawrence
found himself saying "Eight to seven," and mechanically
watched the ball as it sailed through
the air and lodged up in one of the second-story
balconies, and stopped to listen to them set up
the cry, just as he knew they were going to,
"Thank you, up there, please, thank you-u-u!"</p>

<p>It struck him as queer that all this was going
on just as it always had, without a single variation
to show that this day was different from
other days. It seemed odd to think that he
was not to be a part of this any more. It somehow
seemed more odd than sad. He told himself
that it would be a great relief to fly far
away from it all.</p>

<p>Down the walk came a group of his own
class-mates, carelessly slouching along from lecture,
laughing and joking, with their arms on
one another's shoulders. It was Linton and
Nolan and Stehman and others. "Hello, there,
Harry!" they said and passed on down the walk.
Lawrence turned and watched them. He had
replied to their salute in his usual manner. It
had seemed natural and his voice was in perfect
imitation of heartiness, and yet he could not
help thinking how little difference it would
make to him if they all fell down dead. The
sight of them bothered, Nolan's bow legs annoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
him. He hoped he would never see
Nolan again. And this was Billy Nolan!</p>

<p>The bell was echoing and re-echoing in his
ears, and each stroke fairly made him jump.
The sight of so many people and the knowledge
that there were others behind him were
beginning to give him a feeling of distress. He
felt that he could not stand having so many
people press close to him. It was somehow
rattling him. Everything he saw hurt, and he
only wanted to get far away from it all. For
he told himself that he hated the campus and
its life, and everything that had to do with it.
The very expression of the buildings was offensive
to him. He wanted to upset the wheelbarrow
and its sticky contents when old black
Jimmie touched his hat to him, and he felt like
kicking two innocent seminoles that hurried
past with quick, conscientious steps that made
their coat-tails flap behind. All of this was
nervous nonsense, and he knew it.</p>

<p>He left the crowded walk and walked over
toward the cannon and leaned against a nearby
elm-tree. Then he fixed his gaze steadily upon
the top of the old cannon and tried to think of
nothing else. He had learned to take himself
in hand this way during his overworked football
season. "It isn't so bad as all this," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
said aloud to himself. "You are still rocky and
your blamed nerves are getting in their work
again. That's all it is. Now, then, hold on.
You aren't a hysterical little school-girl, you
know."</p>

<p>In a moment he started on toward Dickinson
Hall again. "We are going to a lecture now,"
he explained to himself in a whisper, "and we're
going to hear lots of interesting things. We
can talk over all those other matters later on.
There's plenty of time, plenty of time."</p>

<p>He took a long, full breath, as though to hold
on tight, and threw up his head and looked
squarely into a pair of brown eyes that were
gazing intently at him. It was That Freshman.</p>

<p>He had often wondered why he was constantly
running across this same little freshman with
the sensitive mouth and the large, thoughtful
eyes. He did not know his name, but he enjoyed
observing from the patronizing height of
a senior an air of delicate refinement in the
features and movements of the boy. Sometimes
when in a good humor he nodded to him.
But just now the peculiar wistful gaze breaking
in on him in his tossed-up state of mind seemed
eerie. For an instant he had a feeling of guilty
fright, as if caught doing something. And then,
because angry with himself for being startled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
by a freshman, he blurted out, in a husky voice,
"Oh, what do you want?"</p>

<p>The under-classman blushed and stepped
back. He said something incoherent ending
with "Why&mdash;er&mdash;nothing&mdash; I beg pardon."
He attempted a smile, failed, colored more than
ever, dropped his eyes in embarrassment, and
with a sort of shiver turned on his heel.</p>

<p>The senior, with his own harsh voice still
echoing in his ear, stood there with his hands in
his pockets watching the younger boy shrinking
before him. Then something inside of him
was touched. He felt how brutally rude he
had been, and he wanted to make amends for it.
He felt more than that. He wanted to be kind
to this boy with the refined face; he wanted to
be tender toward him, to protect him, or something
queer and wild like that. Though he did
not acknowledge it to himself tears were ready
to come to his dark, blood-shot eyes with the
dark rings under them, and he had an impulse
to throw his arm about the freshman's shoulder
and say: "You dear little fellow!" Neurasthenia
could account for some of this.</p>

<p>As it was he turned and followed the freshman
from the side of the new bulletin-elm,
where this took place, to the corner of the Old
North. Here, hardly realizing what he was doing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
he touched his shoulder and said, in a gruff
voice, though he did not mean it to be, "Don't
you want to take a walk?"</p>

<p>But even if he had stopped to think about its
being an odd thing to do, it would have made
no difference. He was hardly in a mood for
considering conventionalities.</p>

<p>After awhile he found himself walking with the
freshman way out toward the Prep. school. To
the left was the old view of rolling fields and the
gentle hill. Underfoot were the uneven stones
of the old walk with water-puddles in the hollowed-out
places. And there beside him walked
the freshman, talking in a natural tone about a
fine tennis-player that he thought was coming
to college next year. It was all quite as if it
were an ordinary occurrence.</p>

<p>Lawrence could remember the freshman's
look of surprise as they started across the campus,
and he recollected murmuring some apology
for his rudeness by saying that he thought
it was someone else at first. Then he must have
started the conversation by asking the freshman
what recitation he had just had. But after that
it was all a blank until now. He was under the
impression that he had been nodding to people,
but he could not remember who they were or
anything about them except a big-visored, faded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
crimson cap that someone had on. Probably he
had been carrying on the conversation automatically
with the freshman, but it must have been
all right, for the boy did not look as though anything
strange had happened. But a very great
deal had.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a sort of hypnotism, though
very likely it could be explained as nothing of
the kind, but at any rate from the moment his
thoughts had been stopped with a jerk at meeting
the freshman they had taken a different
turn. With the boy at his side and his gentle
voice in his ears Lawrence had begun thinking
about another red-cheeked boy he had known
once; and it seemed much more than four
years ago. He felt again the very expression of
those old bright days at school when he took
prizes and played on the eleven. He remembered
the old field and how the afternoon sun
used to reflect from one of the windows near
by. There came back to him the very odor of
the polished desk in the school-room where he
scratched H. L. L., and all the little details of
those dear old days of happy monotony and innocent
amusements. He felt again the old excitement
of an approaching vacation. He remembered
how he used to check off the days on
the calendar over the mantelpiece, and he remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the first trip he took home alone and
the blue serge suit he wore, of which he was so
proud, and how he wondered who would meet
him at the station, and best of all, how he used
to jump out of the carriage and run up the
steps of home and meet the one that came out
into the hall to meet him. Joyously and innocently
he used to look up into the soft gray
eyes that seemed to say, "I am proud of my
boy." But that was a peculiar thing to think of
just now. A passage in his father's letter occurred
to him. "Of course I did not, nor shall I
advise your mother of all this"&mdash;he had had to
turn the page, he remembered, to find the rest of
it&mdash;"it would break her heart." "Of course," he
said to himself, hurriedly, "it wouldn't do at all."
Then he thought he did not care to dwell upon
old times any more. It was at this point that
he awoke, so to speak, and found himself walking
with this freshman whose name he did not
know.</p>

<p>But instead of everything springing back to
actuality immediately as one would suppose, it
took some time to hammer things into seeming
as they really were in their proper proportions.
It was like trying to act sober. He began by
paying conscious attention to what his young
friend was saying.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>After all he was only a freshman. He talked
like any other fellow except that his voice was
more gentle, and he had a deferential manner
when addressing him. Though rather young to
be in college and of unusual appearance, there
was not enough about him to affect a fellow in
such a queer sentimental way.</p>

<p>And yet he did. To Lawrence he seemed
different from everyone else in the world. He
had never experienced this peculiar melting feeling
toward anyone before. What was more, he
liked it, and he had no thought of laughing himself
out of it. He had an undefined idea that it
was doing him good. He felt like clinging close
to this companion who was younger and seemed
so many times better and purer than himself.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the senior was struck by something
he had not remarked before. He waited
a moment to make sure. Then it came again.
There was no mistaking it this time. The refined
voice was dragging in profanity at absurdly
frequent intervals, with every other sentence
almost. He had very likely been doing so all
along. And the odd part of this was that every
word of it was making Lawrence wince and
shiver like seeing a respectable woman drunk.
It was none of his business. It was all nonsense.
The expletives were not very bad ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
anyway. But he did not care to stand any more
of this; and as abruptly as he had proposed the
walk he said: "Oh, excuse me, I have an engagement,"
and turned rapidly toward the campus.
Perhaps neurasthenia had a hand in this
also.</p>

<p>He did not stop to see how the freshman took
it. He did not want to think of him now. He
fairly ran up Nassau Street with a feeling as
though someone was after him. He rushed past
the fellows along the walk and nearly bumped
into the three old professors starting off with
the Irish setter for their sedate evening stroll.
He was trembling when he reached his room,
and he slammed the door and threw himself
down on the rug before the fire.</p>

<p>He knew something was coming. He knew
what it was, too, but he was going to fight it off
as long as he could. He drew the end of the fur
skin up over his head and pressed hard with
both hands, as though that would keep him from
thinking of what he did not want to think.
Then he rubbed the back of his hand across his
wet brow and tried to sneer the thing away as
he had always been able to do at other times.
But this was not at all like any of the other
times, and it would not work. Besides his
nerves were in no shape for a fight of this sort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and he soon gave up. He let his head fall back
against the rug and he lay there flat on the floor
while the aching thoughts came soaking over
him. All this had been accumulating for many
days. The freshman had set it off.</p>

<p>And it was not as if he had only a little to
feel sorry over. He could not even say, "I'm no
worse than most fellows," for he had gone
quite far indeed, much farther than anyone in
the world, except two or three, had any idea of,
and he had things to remember that very few
older sinners than he would often care to think
about. It seemed so certain to him now, as he
lay there breathing hard and staring at the fire
as though expecting it to jump out at him, that
these remembrances were never going to let up
on him for a single moment; as long as he
lived, no matter how he might live in the future,
these unforgetable things were, from this time
on, to rise up and spoil every bit of sweetness
in life for him.</p>

<p>But that was not what hurt the most. It was
just and reasonable that all that should be as it
was. It was the thought of his people at home
that was making him squirm and roll over
toward the desk and then back again toward
the fire. What had they done to deserve this?
He could not understand. Aside from all consideration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
of right and wrong, or wisdom and
folly, he was astounded at the thought of how
a fellow could be so dead, dead unkind. It
would not seem possible at first. He kept asking
himself, "Is this really true? Is it really
true?"</p>

<p>For an hour he lay there on the floor, with
his remorse and his sick nerves, telling himself
the kind of a fellow he was, while the rest of
the college went to dinner.</p>

<p>After this came the reaction, the natural instincts
of love and yearning for the home that
he had left. He told himself how that vacations
would come, and little Dick, the prep.,
would come, and Helen and all would come out
there to the old place on Long Island&mdash;all but
one. His place at the table would be vacant.
No, there would be no place for him. They
would avoid mentioning his name. They would
change the subject when visitors referred to
him. After awhile visitors would learn not to
refer to him. He would be known as "the one
that went to the devil."</p>

<p>All his self-reliance had been squeezed out
of him. He did not care to be independent
now. He did not want to be free. He wanted&mdash;oh,
how he wanted!&mdash;a place to go to and people
to care about him, like everyone else. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
shrank from the thought of standing alone.
He did not feel equal to it. He felt himself to
be nothing but a boy, after all, a bad, foolish,
wilful, sick boy, and he wanted to run home
and, just for once, let his throbbing head fall
into his mother's lap and have her hands smooth
the ache out of it. But of course he could do
nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>The more he thought of it the more impossible
it appeared. Why, for four years&mdash;he half
arose from the rug and his face became hot at
the thought of it&mdash;for four years he had been doing
things that she would not believe him capable
of; not if he told her himself. No, he was not
going to sneak into the home-fold like a cowardly
prodigal, bleating, "I have been a bad
little boy, papa. Take me back, and I'll promise
not to be bad any more." He was not that
kind. He deserved his husks, and he meant
to chew them, even though they stuck in his
throat. To keep away, he showed himself,
was one means left him to regain a little of the
self-respect that he had lost.</p>

<p>Then he arose with something of his former
indifference and laughed at himself a little.
"You've felt sorry for yourself long enough,"
he said aloud; "what you've got to do now is to
make the best of it." He started toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
desk to take the first steps toward making the
best of it. He stopped in the middle of the
room and looked about at the pictures and the
pipes and the books. "I'm done with college,"
he said, briskly. "Now I feel better."</p>

<p>He lighted a pipe to show himself how much
better he felt, and began to word a telegram
to Clark. That would finish a good day's work,
he thought. A very long day it seemed, too.
Some things were hazy and dream-like. That
walk with the freshman&mdash; But he did not want
to think about that, and he wrote down "W. G.
Clark, care West, Houston &amp; Co."</p>

<p>Yet, though he tried not to listen, there began
coming up to him the tones of the gentle voice
dragging in profanity with such pathetic pains.
"But I don't want to think about that!" Lawrence
exclaimed. But all the while he wrote the
message he heard the timid voice with the incongruous
words.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't do that," he said aloud.
"It bothers me. Why do you want to do
that?" He dipped his pen in the ink and held
it there. Why did he? Then it came over
him with a blush of shame that it was doubtless
to find favor in his sight. Most people would
have guessed it before.</p>

<p>And then something flashed through his mind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
something that he had heard early in the term.
A freshman named Jansen, whom he had looked
out for when he first arrived, had told him of a
freshman that was always talking and asking
questions about him. Lawrence had entirely
forgotten this, and the recollection of it made
him start up from his seat. This accounted
for the freshman's haunting him on the campus,
gazing at him, imitating his style of dress even.</p>

<p>It was quite ridiculous. He tried to sneer it
out of his mind. But he could not. He was
finding that there were some things that could
not be sneered away. But that was not all.</p>

<p>A big question met him like a huge, choking
wave&mdash;"What will this boy's future be?" And
Lawrence pleaded, "Oh, let me alone! Never
mind all that."</p>

<p>The wave drew back and another came drenching
over him&mdash;"Will he do as you have done?"</p>

<p>"Don't, please don't!" cried Lawrence.
There came up before him in his sick mind
lurid, revolting scenes, and in them a fair-faced
boy with a sensitive mouth learning to like it all.
Then came a third wave&mdash;"Who will be responsible?
What are you going to do about
it?" This was a little too much for Lawrence.
He felt powerless to think it out just now. He
would need time for this. Unconsciously he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
stepped back to the rug. He lay there, very
quiet, almost motionless, until far into the
night.</p>

<p>Then he arose, a very different boy from
Lawrence the President, greatly feared of under-classmen,
and felt his way through the dark to
the bedroom. Here he locked the door and
prayed to God, as he had been brought up to
do.</p>

<p>The next morning one of the clerks, harrying
by the ticker where Colonel Lawrence seemed
to be bending over the tape, suddenly exclaimed,
"Why, what is it, sir? Nothing serious,
I hope?"</p>

<p>Old Colonel Lawrence, drawing himself up
and gazing straight ahead of him as he crumpled
a telegram in his hand, made answer, "No.
My son is coming home to spend Sunday with
me. That is all."</p>

<p>The clerk did not know that they were tears
of joy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>

<h2>FIXING THAT FRESHMAN</h2>

<p class="center p2">I</p>

<p>Lawrence, Ninety Blank, wearily knocked
four under-classmen off the walk on the
way from the railway station to West College.
Then, feeling better, he dragged himself up the
entry stairs, threw his suit-case at the bedroom
portière with a sigh of relief and himself on the
divan with a sense of having done his duty.</p>

<p>The Glee, Banjo, and Mandolin Clubs had
just returned from their Christmas holiday tour
through the South. The trip had been a success
both in the money and the fine impression
the clubs had made, which latter would advertise
the college. And that is the object of this
enterprise and is too valuable for the trustees
to abolish.</p>

<p>They had travelled in a special train of private
cars lent by the parents of some of the
members. They had had a very good time, because
a Glee club trip is always bound to have
that, and because Southern people know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
help young men in this respect about as well as
any people in the world. Lawrence was glad
it was over.</p>

<p>He had not intended to go on the trip this
year. He had been on the club since he was a
freshman. He knew all there was to know
about it, and there could be little novelty in
this sort of thing for him. But that was not
the reason.</p>

<p>Of course it was not. Harry Lawrence enjoyed
travelling about the country with a rollicking
lot of congenial fellows, and being made
much of by old grads., and admired before the
glare of foot-lights by millions of attractive
girls, and dancing with them afterwards until
three o'clock in the morning, like any other
normal, healthy young man. It was not because
he was <i>blasé</i>. He wasn't that sort of fool.</p>

<p>In the first place Lawrence had suddenly
gone home, early in December, with something
pronounced by a little, short doctor with mild
blue eyes which saw everything to be a form
of neurasthenia. This was brought on by overwork
and worry and other causes. He had
held a position of considerable responsibility
during the football season. He had worried
over it a good deal.</p>

<p>Although, when he reached home, he braced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
up with astonishing rapidity, he conceived a
notion that instead of flying over the United
States at the rate of ever so many miles an
hour, he would like very well to sit still and
yawn by the fireplace at home with slippers on.</p>

<p>His mother opened up the old place on Long
Island for a part of every winter, and he thought
he could put in a very comfortable old-fashioned
vacation out there with her. He had an idea
that it would do him good to take some long
tramps over the meadows with a gun and a dog,
and to spend whole afternoons on a horse with
pure country air whistling in his ears. Perhaps,
if he felt right cocky, he might borrow
some pinks of his brother-in-law and ride to
the hounds with his Ass-cousins on New Year's
Day. And the evenings would pass pleasantly
enough in fighting with Helen, his married sister,
across the table, and in guying his kid brother
Dick, the prep.; and then he meant to have
many long after-dinner smoke-talks with his
father, with whom he had recently become acquainted.
It was on this last account, as much
as any, that he wanted to stay at home.</p>

<p>But one of the second basses had the grip
and another a dead grandmother, and that side
of the stage was weak anyway. So Doc. Devereaux,
the leader of the club, followed his two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
letters and three telegrams out to Compton on
the Sound, and grabbed Lawrence by the coat-collar.
He had brought with him a reprieve
from the little blue-eyed doctor, stating that
Lawrence could go if he would promise to keep
on with the hot and cold baths, and to eat tremendously.
Devereaux begged and pleaded,
and put it on grounds of personal friendship.
When he shed tears, almost, and said, "For the
honor of old Nassau won't you, Harry?" Lawrence
looked bored and said he would think
about it. But only upon condition that Doc
would stay for dinner and spend the night at
Compton, which he did.</p>

<p>When Colonel Lawrence came out from town
and had comfortably finished his dinner, and in
his stately fashion had taken out a long black
cigar, Harry, who had been waiting, said, "Now
then, father," and told him why Devereaux was
there, and asked him what to do about it.</p>

<p>Lawrence, Fifty Blank, knocked the ashes off,
looked at Lawrence, Ninety Blank, and took
three puffs of smoke. "Well, Harry," he said,
"if the college needs you, there is but one way
of looking at it." Lawrence, the younger, said
"Yes, sir," and packed his suit-case.</p>

<p>Having decided to do his duty, he made up
his mind that while he was about it he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
enter into the spirit of the thing and have a
good time. Of course this was not as satisfactory
to himself as wearing a long face and telling
himself what a martyr he was, but it was
pleasanter for his friends.</p>

<p>These trips are not only good fun, they are
part of one's education. They are very broadening.
Lawrence wanted to be broad-minded.
The only times he had travelled in his own
country were with the Glee Club, and he
thought every young man ought to know something
of his fatherland.</p>

<p>He held that most New Yorkers were narrow-minded
in this respect, and he did not intend
to be. New York ways of doing things were
good enough for him, because they were the
best, but he wanted to see how other Americans
looked at things; and this showed a generous
spirit.</p>

<p>On a previous trip he had visited a portion
of the Western section of his country, and had
brought back several new ideas. For instance,
he was pleasantly surprised to meet girls with
the same innate ideas that he had supposed
were the exclusive possession of his friends at
home. That was broadening. Also he had it
impressed upon him that young women living in
little towns he had never heard of before had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
characteristics, not necessarily innate, which
were calculated to make very young men realize
that even members of college dance committees
have a thing or two to learn. Which was still
more broadening.</p>

<p>And now he was in Virginia, surrounded by
much dazzling full-pulsed Southern loveliness.
He was meeting people that had been brought
up to consider themselves the aristocracy of the
American side of the world, and they had been
cherishing this idea for generations before New
York was more than a trading-post of miserly,
Indian-cheating Dutchmen. They had never
heard of the Lawrences of New York and were
rather sorry for anyone that had to live there.
And this was broadening. This was not to be
about the Glee Club trip, nor about what Lawrence
would have done if he had not gone, but
what happened afterward, and if you read this
story you may skip to here: Lawrence lay on
the divan.</p>

<p>He put his hands back of his head and tried
to tell himself how sick he was of teas and club
receptions and convivial old grads. and applause
and dances and chicken-salad and girls.
Cinders were in his hair. What he wanted
most in all the world was, first, someone to
carry him to a Turkish bath, second, someone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
to dress him in his campus clothes, and third,
Billy Nolan to put an arm around and call names.</p>

<p>But this reactional feeling he knew was inevitable,
and he took it, as he did his sensation
of dirtiness and indigestion, as part of the game.
There was something else to make him fidget
and frown on the divan.</p>

<p>Lawrence had come back to the slushy old
sunshiny campus a very different fellow from
the one that used to climb the stone steps from
the station, but he had had a month in which
to become accustomed to it. Besides, that was
nothing to be sour about. He was very well
pleased with being a different sort of a fellow,
and had made up his mind to remain so. In
fact, all during the trip he had been thinking
that he could put in a peaceful, comfortable time
now for the rest of his life, if it were not for
one thing.</p>

<p>And as he started across the campus with a
roll of corduroys under his arm, and the intention
of taking a bath at the club, the very
first thing he saw was that One Thing.</p>

<p>There was a "Hunt's Discourse" under his
arm, and he was running to reach his seat before
the bell stopped ringing, like any other
freshman. But he was different from every
other freshman in the world, to Lawrence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>This boy, like some of every freshman class
that ever cheered itself hoarse, was beginning
to do things his father had not sent him to college
for. And the senior had an idea that his
own example was what had started the boy;
and this, when you stop to think of it, was extremely
conceited in him. He thought he could
make the freshman stop, and this, when you
stop to think of it, was a hasty conclusion.</p>

<p>He thought about it during the time occupied
in splashing and spluttering at the club, and
most of the time that he was shivering and
whistling and putting on his ugliest sweater and
oldest corduroys and most disreputable slouch
hat, and his brown shooting-coat with quail
blood on it. He even thought of it several
times while his hands were deep down in his
pockets and his shoulders were slouched forward
and a pipe was in his mouth and an arm
was around Jim Linton and they were floating
about the campus calling hello to everybody
that was back.</p>

<p>The first thing undertaken by Lawrence, the
entirely different, was the purchasing of some
fine large text-books. For his foremost duty
was of course toward himself.</p>

<p>He had never bought any books since freshman
year, but he knew where they were to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
found, and a poler named Stacy gave him a list
of the ones he required.</p>

<p>They were all nice new copies, with the
book-store smell about them. He did not like
second-handed ones, and then, too, he was going
to pole very hard and he might wear them
out. Besides, his book bill had never been
large&mdash;except in his letters&mdash;and he thought
he could afford the extravagance in his senior
year.</p>

<p>He took great pleasure in writing his full
name on the fly-leaf with a blotty pen, Henry
Laurence Lawrence, Jr., in a flourishless hand
like his father's. They made quite an imposing
pile on the table, and he felt proud of it. He
showed them to the fellows that dropped in
that evening to say, "Glad to see you back,"
and ask him what he thought of Southern
girls. This took until 2 <span class="s08">A.M.</span> So he could
not attend to that other matter until the next
day.</p>

<p>He set the alarm-clock before going to bed
and said, "Now, then, to-morrow I fix my freshman."</p>

<p>He jumped out with only six hours' sleep,
though he had just finished a long journey
and his nerves required more rest, all to make
chapel and see his freshman. He saw him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>Although he said only, "How do you do?"
in a serious tone, he knew that he was doing
his duty, and felt so pleased with himself that
he went to town that afternoon and took a
Turkish bath at his place in Twenty-eighth
Street&mdash;this was the only way to get the
cinders out&mdash;and stole some clean linen from
his brother-in-law's top bureau drawer, and
dined with the family at home. Then, because
he had not been with them during Christmas,
and because he was to be a poler for the rest
of his college course and would have few such
chances, he stayed over Sunday and was given
a pensum for too many unexcused absences
when he came back.</p>

<p>On Monday, however, he saw his freshman
again. It was on Nassau Street. This time
Lawrence said, "Hello there!" He saw him
once more on Tuesday, coming out of Whig
Hall, and said, "How are you, Darnell?" and
smiled a little. He saluted the freshman in various
ways every day but one for a week.</p>

<p>This delighted the freshman very much, but
somehow had no effect upon his morals. Lawrence
felt like a man wasting breath, and he did
not believe in wasting breath on under-classmen.
This young Darnell was decidedly unappreciative.
Besides it was unwarrantably fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
in him to give all this trouble to a senior, and
Lawrence made up his mind to some day tell
him so.</p>

<p>If it had been a good hard jumping-on that
were needed, Lawrence thought he could have
managed, but this thing required tact and delicacy,
which he hadn't. Some fellows, like Jim
Linton, would not have minded a queer, unconventional
situation of this sort. Lawrence was
not that kind. He knew as little about telling
a fellow that he was on the verge of making a
fool of himself as he did about informing people
that they had souls, or that they should
study hard. It made him blush to think of it.</p>

<p>Besides, what force would this sort of thing
have coming from Lawrence, Ninety Blank?
That was the disadvantage of having a reputation
like his. Nor could he very well halt the
freshman on the campus and say, "See here.
Stop this. I am a good boy now. You also
must be a good boy." Ugh!</p>

<p>The mid-year examinations would be on in a
week or two, or three, and for the present he
was simply obliged to leave off reforming the
freshman&mdash;especially as he had decided that
it would look nice this time for his report to go
home without any conditions on it. It was his
duty to pole.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>Study, after all, is what one comes to college
for. It would doubtless have displeased his
parents if they knew that he was wasting valuable
opportunities, which come but once, over a
little freshman who was no relative of the Lawrences.</p>

<p>He poled very hard and was conditioned in
nothing. So hard did he work, indeed, that
when the long, nervous strain was over there
was very little stuff left in him. At the senior
dance, which came on the evening after the last
examination, he ran three girls' cards, and tried
to make each think that she was the only reason
he had come. This has been tried before. The
next day he felt a slight touch of the old trouble.</p>

<p>He became alarmed about himself, felt his
pulse, and decided that he needed a rest. He
spent three days and ten of his new term cuts
at Lakewood. The One of the three girls was
there spending Lent.</p>

<p>When he came back to the campus he bumped
against that freshman by the lamp-post in front
of South Reunion. He was walking with a
sportive young class-mate named Thompson,
who was a typical little fool, and Darnell said
"Hello, Lawrence!" in a tone which just missed
being fresh, and seemed to mean "See, I'm not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
such a poler as you thought." For five minutes
Lawrence forgot there was a place called
Lakewood, where tall pines murmur.</p>

<p>That evening he heard things about his freshman
that he did not want to hear. They were
not very bad, but quite enough so to make Lawrence
look up his address in the catalogue. He
didn't know how to talk to freshmen. They nearly
all looked alike. But he rang the door-bell.</p>

<p>It was Saturday evening and Darnell was not
in. Lawrence frowned and held that freshmen
had no business leaving their studies at night.
He shook his head and went back to Jim Linton's
room. The freshman had not returned
when he called again at eleven.</p>

<p>Lawrence now thought that he had a right to
be indignant. He had left a comfortable room,
a game of whist, and three class-mates, who gave
him many abusive epithets for it, all to talk to
this freshman. And see how he was treated!
Besides, it wasn't as if Lawrence wanted anything
of him. What pleasure was it to him to
talk to a little ass freshman? But he was doing
his duty anyway.</p>

<p>It did not discourage him. He was not that
sort of a fellow. He only shook his head and
arose early the next morning, which was Sunday.
He hurried through breakfast without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
stopping to read the papers, and marched
straight to the freshman's room on the way to
morning service.</p>

<p>Darnell was in bed with a throbbing brow
and a slight attack of remorse. Lawrence sat
down on a trunk which would have held the
freshman's clothes if he had taken them off, and
cut a good sermon by the dean in order to give
himself the chance of preaching one himself.</p>

<p>"Of course it is not strictly any of my business,
but I think you are making a big mistake.</p>

<p>"You must know that it is no great pleasure
for me to go out of my way to call a man a fool.
But you see I have been through all this myself
and I know very nearly all there is to know
about it. I have been a great fool in college,
and if I can do anything that will prevent another
from making the mistakes I made, I
ought to go ahead and risk hurting his feelings.
Oughtn't I? There's nothing hypocritical in
that. Is there?</p>

<p>"This thing of wild oats, Darnell, is all
wrong, all nonsense, all Tommy-rot. You know
that as well as I do. Of course many people
say&mdash; But those that say such things are either
brutes with no finer sensibilities, or else they
are liars, or else they never had any wild oats.
They don't know what they're talking about.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, of course, I'm only a very young man,
after all. Older men, many of them, would
laugh and call me a young prig, I suppose.
But I know what I'm talking about as regards
myself, Darnell. I know the things I have to
think about and cannot forget. I know the
things that come up and stare me in the face
and make me ache. I know&mdash; But never mind
all that.</p>

<p>"This is what I want to ask of you: Tell me&mdash;you've
had your little taste of it now, the
glamour is rubbed off, you find there is not quite
so much in it as you thought&mdash;tell me honestly,
my boy, do you believe it pays? Don't you
think that one morning like this, with a head
such as you have now, and the thoughts inside
of it, with a sight of those photographs over
there on the bureau, is enough to counterbalance
all the fun there is in a month of last
nights?"</p>

<p>To this long speech the freshman made no
reply, because Lawrence did not say a word of
it aloud. In fact most of those grand-stand remarks
were not thought out until late that night
in bed, while rolling over trying to get to sleep.
He would not have voiced them to the freshman
anyway. Of course not.</p>

<p>It certainly was "not strictly his business"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
to walk into the room of a nodding acquaintance
and call him a fool in long sentences. Lawrence
knew that. And it would have been even worse
taste to open up his own bosom and drag out
his own private worries and dangle them before
the eyes of another. It is only in certain short
stories that such absurdities are performed by
reserved young men. Lawrence was not that
kind of a fool.</p>

<p>The Sunday morning conversation ran something
like this, while Lawrence tied and untied
the freshman's four-in-hand neck-tie about the
foot-post of the bed:</p>

<p>"The Fifty-seventh Street Harrisons? Yes,
very well. Were they down there?...
Is that so?&mdash;to Clint Van Brunt? But I don't
like her so well as her sister. Grace is a
smooth dancer though.... At Sherry's last
winter...." And similar nonsense until
the conversation swung round to the prospects
of the baseball team, which had recently begun
practice in the cage. Then they both woke up
and said something.</p>

<p>And throughout it all the freshman was wondering
why the mighty senior honored him with a
visit, and longing for a drink of very cold water.</p>

<p>Lawrence told himself that this call was merely
to break the ice. You couldn't expect him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to talk about such serious things when they
were hardly acquainted. Could you?</p>

<p>He went again within a few days. He
thought he ought to strike while the iron was
hot. It was in the evening this time, and the
freshman was brighter and better looking. Lawrence
liked him more than ever, only he wished
that he would not be quite so deferential toward
him. Also he greatly wished that he would
not consider it necessary to tack those superfluous
words to his remarks. It bothered him.
They seemed to come out of the refined mouth
side wise. Sometimes they stuck, as it were,
and hung there while Lawrence shivered. And
the more obvious Lawrence made it that he did
not consider such emphasis essential to his own
observations, the more frequently did Darnell
drag it in. This was to show the senior that
he need not refrain on his account.</p>

<p>This time Lawrence remained until midnight.
They did not once mention the people they both
knew in town. They talked about tramping in
the Harz Mountains.</p>

<p>It was evident on his third visit that the
freshman considered Lawrence's frequent coming
due to approval of his development. He
stuck it on worse than ever. Lawrence was
discouraged and looked it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>The freshman, wondering why his senior
friend was so silent, suddenly lifted his big
brown eyes. Lawrence was gazing mournfully
at him. Naturally this made him feel queer.
He became rattled and blushed. Lawrence became
rattled and nearly did; and then arose,
left abruptly, and kicked himself all the way up
Nassau Street, and all along the stone walk past
the dean's house, by Old North, in front of Reunion,
and into West, where he sneaked up to
bed. He did not call again for a month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the freshman was doubtless running
as fast as his legs could carry him, with
Thompson and others of that ilk, to the devil.
And H. L. Lawrence, Ninety Blank, who by
wicked example had started him going, was doing
nothing to stop him. Which was the very
best thing he could have done.</p>

<p>For this is a sort of a disease, and if it's there
it's bound to manifest itself, like other things
that break out at about this age. Any fatherly,
well-meaning interference, such as a fellow like
Lawrence might offer, would have had directly
the opposite of the desired effect. If you do
not believe this, it clearly indicates that you do
not understand it.</p>

<p>Lawrence did not. He, poor devil, skulked
off and tried to forget about the freshman, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
a rejected lover, and, again like one, he could
not, even though he went across the street to
avoid meeting those big eyes.</p>

<p>Once more he took a long breath and sneaked
off to the freshman's room with a brave lot of
kind, smiling advice which he practised saying
on the way over. In a moment he came running
back to the campus, shouting for joy. The
freshman was not at home.</p>

<p>He yelled "Yea" with all his might and
danced three times about the cannon, all alone,
like a man back on the campus in midsummer.
Then because it was Princeton someone else
yelled "Yea-a!" from over by Clio Hall. Then
Jack Stehman raised his window and yelled
"Cork up!" because he felt like it. Someone
in East yeaed back in a shrill voice. Tommy
Tucker stepped out upon his balcony in Reunion
and echoed it mightily. Someone blew a
horn, a big Thanksgiving game horn. Others
took it up. Windows were thrown open all
over the campus. Many voices sounded the ancient
cry of "Fresh fire! Heads out!" Shotguns
banged. Fire-crackers exploded. Bugles
sounded. Distant Dod took up the echo. Witherspoon
Hall was already doing its part.</p>

<p>Within two minutes Lawrence was joined by
a score of fellows who danced with him about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
cannon, yelled "Fresh fier-r-r! Heads out!"
until they had brought everyone out they could,
then called "Leg pull. All over!" and ran
back to their rooms again, feeling that they had
done their duty. Windows slammed shut again.
A voice from down in Edwards Hall answered
"All over!" Every one went on where he left
off. All felt refreshed and strengthened for their
duties, and Lawrence leaned alone against the
cannon. But he too felt better.</p>

<p>He decided that this was a species of Providential
interposition, a sort of vision as it were,
the interpretation of which was that any man
who would allow a little fool freshman to destroy
the happiness of the culminating year of the
best period of life in the dearest spot on earth
would be an unmitigated ass.</p>

<p>He now fell to distracting his mind with work
and other things, and realized the beauty of existence,
as all undergraduates should. Besides
the beauty of existence there were others that he
was in the habit of dwelling upon during sunset
rambles through the woods down toward the
canal; pretty little foolish thoughts which young
men who are still students and have yet to
choose an occupation have no business in thinking.
But the way her hair swept back from that
brow of hers on either side of the chaste part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and then swirled&mdash; But that will do. Lawrence
and his affairs already occupy too much space.</p>

<p>And as suddenly as they were interrupted in
that paragraph were his walking-time thoughts
cut short whenever that confounded freshman
loomed up with an arm about the Thompson
boy, followed by a brindle bull-dog and a trail of
cigarette-smoke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">II</p>

<p>Gussie Thompson was an angel-faced
child with pretty ringlety hair, and he had
come to college from a strict boarding-school
with the intention of making a bad man of himself.
And when a boy wants badly to go to the
devil there is no reason why he should find it
very difficult. In this thought I find I have been
anticipated by Virgil.</p>

<p>But though the descent is easy it does not
follow that it is always graceful. Thompson,
who was conscientiously trying to do it properly,
had his discouragements and sour balls just
as often as the poler who sat in the next seat
and wore trousers that were too short.</p>

<p>People persistently considered Gussie disgustingly
good, when in reality he was very bad
and smoked big black cigars with red and gilt
bands about them. And indeed it is discouraging
to walk down to the football practice with
the gang, breathing cigarette-smoke at every
fifth step, and then have some class-mate you
have nothing to do with ask you, before all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
fellows, to lead class prayer-meeting the next
Sunday. But all that was over long ago.</p>

<p>He now wore the dark bad expression without
any conscious effort. No one asked him where
the Greek lesson was any more. He seldom
had to blow his breath in fellows' faces. And at
the club he was no longer obliged to blink and
say, "How do I look this morning?" they asked
of their own accord, "Full last night, Gus?"
just as some people say "Good-morning."</p>

<p>One evening, at about the beginning of the
season known to some as "bock beer time," he
was in his room surrounded with a few of his
own sort, and a knock came at the door. But
it was not a very loud one, so he did not take
the trouble to answer until there came a second
knock, an emphatic one. Then he emptied a
lungful of cigarette-smoke and shouted, "Come
in and shut your damn racket." He looked up.</p>

<p>Lawrence was framed in the door-way, Lawrence
the senior, with his 'varsity sweater and
his impressive air.</p>

<p>On the campus Lawrence generally nodded to
Thompson, when he remembered him. Once,
not long ago, he had walked up the rear stairs of
Dickinson with him and said, "What do you
fellows have at this hour?" and Gussie wondered
when the clubs held their first elections.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>With his words of apology and welcome
Thompson felt a wave of satisfaction at having a
gang about the table with cards and beer-mugs
on it. He was glad he had strung the champagne-corks
over the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>All of the gang had arisen, and yet this was a
Princeton room. If the senior observed the unusual
mark he showed little gratitude, for without
seeming to be aware of their presence he
said, in his gruff voice, "When will you be at
leisure, Thompson?" and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>He was the sort of senior that could do these
things, and it had the desired effect. They all
remembered that they had engagements and
picked up their caps and said, "So long, old
man," and got out. This was not done constrainedly
but as a perfectly natural thing. And
Gussie beamed.</p>

<p>The door slammed and the freshman said,
"Have a drink, Lawrence."</p>

<p>The senior said, "No, I thank you," and then
contradicted himself, "Yes, I will take a little of
that." He did not approve of little boys having
whiskey in their rooms and big cut-glass decanters
on their bookcases, but he remembered
something. "That's good whiskey, Thompson."
Lawrence sipped and whiffed and held his glass
to the light, "excellent whiskey." He gravely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
smacked his lips. "It reminds me of some
Bourbon they once gave us down in Kentucky,
on the Glee Club trip&mdash;in Louisville, I think it
was. They called it Pendennis Club."</p>

<p>Thompson pushed a cigarette-case across
the table. "That's Pendennis Club," he replied,
simply. "A friend of mine down there
sends it to me. I find you can't get good
liquor in our part of the country. It's all rot-gut."
He twisted his pretty brows into a scowl
and emptied his small lungs of smoke aimed at
the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I see," said Lawrence, looking interested.</p>

<p>"You know what they say about Kentucky,"
the freshman proceeded, "for good whiskey,
fast horses, and pretty women."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lawrence.</p>

<p>The freshman refilled his guest's glass with
Pendennis Club and his own lungs with cigarette-smoke,
which he allowed to seek the free
air of the room slowly, with his head tipped
back and a mouth twisted scornfully as he had
once seen another devil of a fellow do it, who
said, "I don't give a damn for the girl." All
of which was lost on Lawrence, who was rubbing
his chin and looking in the other direction and
wishing he had not come.</p>

<p>"By the way, Thompson, speaking of horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
how did you come out playing the races last
fall? I often saw you on the train going up&mdash;"
this was a lie&mdash;"when I was slaving over football.
Luck stay by you?"</p>

<p>Then the freshman leaned back and said
things about Futurity Stakes and plunging at
Morris Park and a lucky sixteen-to-one shot,
intermingled with a brave lot of profanity and
considerable cigarette smoke. Lawrence wore
the look of a man listening, and thought up
what to say next.</p>

<p>"By the way, Thompson," only it was not by
the way to anything but his own thoughts,
"where's your friend Darnell? I didn't see
him with the others in here."</p>

<p>"No," said the devil of a fellow, "he won't
own up to it, but he's a good bit of a poler at
heart, Lawrence."</p>

<p>"I did not think it of him," said Lawrence,
sincerely. "He's a blame nice fellow though,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Right. He's the best friend I have. He's
pretty young and has a lot of things to learn,
but he's a mighty nice man. Awfully clever chap,
too. Wish I had his brains. I believe he comes
from very nice people in New York, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Thompson, you are dead right in saying
he's too young."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>A beam of pleasure shot across his young
host's face, which was seen by Lawrence, who
now felt all right, and began to talk.</p>

<p>"He's entirely too young, Thompson, and
the deuce of it is that he doesn't realize how
very young he is. A fellow like that never
does. You know what I mean. And as far as
I can see&mdash;I think you had the same thing in
mind a moment ago&mdash;he is about to make a
fool of himself unless he is very careful. He's
entirely too nice a fellow, Thompson, for anything
like that to happen." Lawrence leaned
back and put his feet on the table.</p>

<p>"You see," he continued, "Darnell tries to do
things that you fellows do, who are more mature,
and he doesn't seem to realize that he is only
a boy. Now with you and me it is different.
We are older and know things and have been
around a bit and&mdash; You know what I mean.
We can do a lot of things and have a good time
and be none the worse for it, but as for Darnell,
why, he's a kid, Thompson, a mere kid."</p>

<p>Thompson breathed cigarettes and looked
judicial.</p>

<p>Lawrence moved his chair around so that he
could lean an elbow on the table. He looked
at the fire through the glass of liquid in his
hand. "Thompson, I'm in a hole. A bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
hole, too. I'm going to tell you about it and
maybe ask your advice. I don't mind telling
you because I know you can keep your mouth
shut. I came here this evening for that very
purpose.</p>

<p>"You know I know Darnell's people and all
that. Well, I know his sister quite well."
That happened to be a lie. "And last commencement
when she was down here she asked
me to look after her brother when he entered in
the fall." That happened to be true, though
Lawrence had forgotten it. "She's a pretty
good friend of mine, and whenever I see her"&mdash;he
could not have distinguished her from the
other little girls in the school up-town&mdash;"she
always asks me about her brother. And, well,
Thompson, a fellow hates to lie to a respectable
woman, you know."</p>

<p>"Only a cad will lie to a decent girl," said the
other, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Now, Thompson, I'll tell you
what I think I'll do. I am going to very frankly
ask you to help me out of this hole." Lawrence
looked closely at the freshman. Then he went
on, talking rapidly now with his eyebrows tucked
down and the words coming between his teeth.
Thompson had seen him do it before and had
practised it in his room alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>

<p>"You can do it or not, just as you please, but
you are the only one whom I'd care to ask to
do it. You are the only one I'd trust with it.
In fact, you are the only one that <i>could</i> do it.
Thompson, you know yourself that you have
more influence over Darnell than any man in
the class."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," the freshman feebly
protested.</p>

<p>"Well I do. He has as much as told me so.
I am going to ask you very frankly to&mdash; I don't
know what your views are," the senior interrupted
himself, "but I believe in having all the
fun in the world I can for myself as long as I
mind my own business. But I'd just as soon,
when I have the chance&mdash;" Lawrence looked
down at the whiskey which he was gently swishing
around in his glass. He made his voice
sound as if embarrassed. "Well, dammit, I'm
no saint, but you know it says somewhere that
saving one soul will wipe out a multitude of sins
or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"God knows we have enough of them," said
the devil of a fellow, who now hurled the butt of
his cigarette at the fire and arose from his seat.
He threw back his head and spoke.</p>

<p>"Lawrence, you needn't say any more. I can
give you my answer now." He plunged his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
hands in his pockets and began striding up and
down the room and scowled as he strode.</p>

<p>"Lawrence, I am a peculiar man, and I think
my own thoughts and lead my own life according
to my own ideas. I keep this room here
open to everyone who desires to enter. My
whiskey and tobacco is anybody's who wants it.
And as long as my guests mind their own business
my room is theirs. But when certain
members of my class, certain milksops and
sanctimonious Gospel sharks come up here and
tell me that I am doing wrong and tell me what
it is my duty to do, I very frankly tell them to
go to hell." He looked around the walls at the
Saronys and a French print or two as if to call
them to witness, then went on:</p>

<p>"Lawrence, I perceived your drift from the
start, and at first, I must confess, I was somewhat
taken aback, Lawrence, by your approaching
me on such a subject."</p>

<p>The one listening with a bland look of attention
on his face and his feet on the table
considered this rather fresh, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"But only for a moment," the freshman continued,
"only for a moment, I assure you. You
talked to me like a man to a man, a real man,
not a Gospel shark or a poler, but a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
knows things and yet gives a fellow credit for
some good impulses. I appreciate your situation
exactly. I have been placed in similar ones
myself. I know how it is. And I'm glad you
came up here to-night. You rushed in where
angels would not have dared, and I'm damn
glad you did." He stopped walking the floor.
"Now I'm not accustomed to this sort of thing,
Lawrence, as you must know, and I won't promise
much. But I give you my word, I'll do my
best for Darnell."</p>

<p>Lawrence took the hand Thompson dramatically
held out to him. He restrained another
impulse, an ungrateful one, and said, "Thompson,
I always thought I understood you better
than your own class-mates did." And Gussie
blushed.</p>

<p>The senior arose. "Gus,"&mdash;he called him
Gus&mdash;"I appreciate to a nicety the delicacy of
your position in this matter. Please don't let
it inconvenience you in any way. I shall always
be grateful to you for what you have undertaken
this evening, and if I can ever be of
service to you, please command me." Some of
this was sincere. "I have an engagement now.
Good-night. No, I thank you, no more to-night.
Come up and see me some time, Gus.
Good-night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night, Harry," said the other. "Wish
you would drop up often."</p>

<p>"I know that," thought Lawrence, as he closed
the door, "only I wouldn't say 'Harry' very
often if I were you."</p>

<p>Left alone, Thompson took a gulp of
whiskey straight without wincing very much,
stretched out in a big chair and planned how to
follow his friend Lawrence's suggestions, wrinkling
his brows and looking no doubt very much
like the man of the world that he read about as
he did so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lawrence was saying to himself,
"Still, it's all in a good cause," and hurrying
along the street with his coat-collar turned up,
like a man ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>"This time next year," he was thinking, "I'll
be out of college and hustling in the big world
which recent graduates are always telling me I
know nothing about. I suppose I shall have
to get used to boot-licking and getting pulls.
That's business. But just at present I don't
like the taste." So he hurried up the street for
a counter-irritant, while the mood was on him.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was saying, "The
fact of the matter is, Darnell, I'm in a pretty bad
hole, and I think I'll ask your advice."</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> advice?" said Darnell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if you do not object to giving it."</p>

<p>"I think you know what I mean," said the
freshman, "don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lawrence, "I know what you
mean." He also knew he was finding it a different
matter talking to this freshman.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you about it anyway," he went
on. "Last year, when your friend Gus Thompson's
sister was down here for the sophomore
reception&mdash;what?" The freshman's big eyes
were making him nearly blush.</p>

<p>"Why, Gus is an only child, you know. You
must mean his cousin."</p>

<p>"Did I say sister? I meant cousin. His
cousin, of course&mdash;she's a smooth girl, his cousin.
Well, his cousin got at me and asked me to
look after him when he entered college and see
that he poled and all that. Sort of queer thing,
wasn't it? But I promised to do it, and you
know you hate to lie to a&mdash;well, I hate to deceive
her about it."</p>

<p>Then Lawrence went on to point out that
while he, Darnell, had plenty of fun in life, he
kept up in first division at the same time, which
was the way to do, whereas that boy Thompson,
who seemed rather immature, had two conditions
and was in a good way to being dropped;
and he, Darnell, had considerable influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
over Thompson&mdash;oh, yes, he had: Gus had only
that evening referred to Darnell as his best
friend, and so on. But Lawrence forgot to say
damn this time.</p>

<p>When he finished, the freshman turned toward
the senior two fine-looking eyes filled with surprise
and some other things which caused Lawrence
to feel like a hypocrite, which he was.</p>

<p>"Why," replied Darnell, "of course, Lawrence.
To be sure I don't know how well I can
succeed, but I'll be very glad to try it. And,
Lawrence, I think I ought to tell you that I appreciate
your trusting me in a thing of this nature,
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Lawrence, arising.</p>

<p>"Only, Lawrence," continued the freshman,
who seemed to have something to say, "why
didn't you tell me this was what you wanted
long ago? I would have been willing, I think,
without your cultivating my acquaintance so
long."</p>

<p>"See here," said Lawrence, with his hand on
the door-knob, "to be right honest, I never
dreamed of asking you to do anything of the
sort until this very day. If I cultivated you it
was for yourself and because I like you. I
never told anyone <i>that</i> before. Good-night."</p>

<p>On his way across the campus Lawrence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
stopped and told an innocent old elm-tree this:
"The man that first said '<i>Similia similibus
curantur</i>' was very much of a fool. I feel more
like a fellow cribbing in exams than I did before."
Then he kicked the elm and shouted
"Hello-o, Billy Nolan, are you up there?" and
ran up the stairs to smoke a good-night pipe
and talk about senior vacation. He felt better
in the morning.</p>

<p>It was one evening about a week after this
that young Thompson came running up to Lawrence's
room with a scowl on his face, and talked
like an important man in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Why, he's dead easy! I'll say, 'Aw, let's
get out of here, this beer is rotten.' 'All right,'
he'll say, 'let's wander over to the room.' Minute
we get there he proposes that we pole the
Greek or something. See his idea? He thinks
he'll sour me on being quiet, but, ha, ha! I fool
him every time&mdash;how? Why I just sit down
and pole to beat the band until too late for him
to join the gang. See? Oh, but he's easy! I
have made up my mind to keep that boy from
making a fool of himself, and when I make up
my mind to a thing, I don't believe in crawling.
Besides, poling won't hurt me any."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Thompson," said Lawrence sympathetically.
"I don't see how it can hurt you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>Darnell came in a little later and sat down in
the very same chair and had this to say: "Lawrence,
Gus Thompson is a queer fellow. You
know he doesn't go with the crowd any more,
and because <i>he</i> is sour and doesn't care to have
any good times, he tries to interfere with my
enjoyment too. He's always proposing that we
stay in the rooms&mdash;you know we room together
now. I thought I could look after him better
in that way&mdash; Well, when he kicks on poling
I start to join the gang, and then he says 'All
right, let's pole.' He must be jealous about me.
But that's the way I work him. He's so easy."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lawrence, "lots of people are."

<h2>THE SCRUB QUARTER-BACK</h2>

<p>Tommy Wormsey was a meek little boy
with an ugly face, mostly covered with
court-plaster, and he would rather fall on a football
than eat.</p>

<p>When he came trotting out upon the field, the
college along the side lines always smiled at the
way he tipped his head to one side with his
eyes on the ground, as though he was ashamed
of himself and of his funny little bumpy body,
stuck into a torn suit and stockings which
weren't mates and had holes in them. When he
skimmed over the ground and dived through the
air and brought down a two-hundred-and-something-pound
guard, with his knotty little arms
barely reaching about the big thighs, it looked
very absurd, and when he jumped up again,
yelling "3&mdash;9&mdash;64" in his shrill earnest voice,
and ran sniffling back to his place, with his sorrowful
face seeming to say, "I know I oughtn't
to have let him slide so far, but please don't
scold me this time," the crowd laughed uproariously,
which hurt his feelings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>But he paid very little attention to anything
except the scrub captain's orders and the admonitions
of the coachers, to whom he said,
"Yes, sir," and "I'll try it that way, sir." He was
afraid of them, and looked down at his torn
stockings when they spoke to him. Those of the
crowd along the ropes who knew everything, as
well as the other spectators who only knew a
few things, said that Freshman Wormsey had
more sand and football instinct than any man
on the field. But they did not know what a
coward he was at heart.</p>

<p>More than once when a 'varsity guard had
broken through and jumped on him, and the
scrub halves had fallen on him from the other
direction to keep him from being shoved back,
and the other 'varsity guard and the centre, who
were not light, had thrown themselves upon
these, and one of the ends had swung round and
jumped on the top of the pile on general principles,
Wormsey, at the bottom, said "ouch!"
under his breath, if he had any. He weighed
137 pounds stripped.</p>

<p>At night, after the trick practice with checkers
at the Athletic Club, he always hurried
back to his room, and stacked the pillows and
sofa cushions up in the corner of the room,
with the black one in the centre, and taking his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
place on one knee in the opposite corner, socked
the ball into the pile. Every time he missed
the black one in the centre he called himself
names.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he did this he became excited,
and sprang forward and knocked down
chairs and tables and things. But he paid no
attention to that. He only bit his nails and
fell to passing again, and kept it up sometimes
until eleven o'clock, which was a whole hour
later than he had any business to be out of bed.</p>

<p>But there were days when it became tiresome,
this constant pound, pound, pound, fall down,
get up and pound again, and once in a while
there came dark times when he felt that it all
didn't pay, which was very unpatriotic thinking;
and the next day, when the crowd yelled, "Well
tackled, Wormsey!" he wondered how he could
have been such a mucker as to think it. But it
was rather hard work for a seventeen-year-old
boy whose bones weren't knit to play two thirty-minute
halves every day as hard as they were
doing now, and then practise place kicks and
catching punts afterward, besides keeping hold
of all the signals and systems and stuff that were
drummed into his little head every evening,
along with the rest of the second eleven, in the
room across the hall from the one where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
'varsity were learning their systems and signals
and tricks.</p>

<p>It's all well enough for them. They have
their 'varsity sweaters with the big P on
them, and have their pictures printed in the
papers, and are pointed out and praised and
petted and fondled and fussed over like blue-ribboned
hunters at the horse show; but for the
poor, faithful, unappreciated scrub it's a different
story. There's none of the glory, and all work
and grind and strain at the top notch of capacity.
And nothing at the end of it but thanks
and the consciousness of doing one's duty by the
college. So about this time, when they were
approaching that critical stage in training which
is like getting one's second wind in a cross-country
run, he used to have some terrible times
with himself. If anyone knew what muckerishly
cowardly thoughts he had, he was afraid
they'd fire him from college.</p>

<p>He was ashamed of himself, but he couldn't
help it. He was getting sick of training, sick of
getting up at seven o'clock in the morning and
hurrying down to breakfast while the alarm
clocks were going off in East and West colleges,
and the frost was still on the grass. Every day,
as soon as the morning recitations were over, no
matter what kind of weather, he must jump into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the 'bus at the corner of Dickinson Hall, drive
down to the grounds, undress and dress again,
and hobble out upon the field, and get his poor
little body bumped and pounded and kicked and
trampled on, and the rest of his personality
yelled at by the captain, and scolded by the
coachers, who stand alongside in nicely creased
trousers, with canes in their hands, and call out,
"Line up more quickly, scrub," which is hard to
do when one's lungs are breathless, especially
when one is a quarter-back, and needs a certain
amount of wind to scream out the signals in a
loud enough tone to keep from being sworn
at. And that's the way they make football stuff.</p>

<p>To-day he let Hartshorn drag him five yards
and missed one tackle outright, and he was discouraged.
After the line-up, while they were
practising him at catching punts, he seemed to
have such bad luck holding the ball; and once,
in trying for a wild one when he had run over
by the cinder track, grunting and straining, and
had put up his little arms, only to feel the ball
bounce off his chest, he gnashed his teeth so
loud and said "Oh, dear!" in such a plaintive
whimper, like a child waking from a bad dream,
that two pipe-smoking seniors, who were trooping
out in the rear of the crowd, smiled audibly
and said something about him. He could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
hear what it was. He only heard them laugh,
and it nearly broke his heart. But all that he
could do was to call them things under his breath,
and run sniffling back to his place again.</p>

<p>The trouble with the boy was he had worked
so hard and worried so much that he was over-trained,
and so, naturally, there was not much
ginger left in him. And the reason the keen-eyed
trainer did not see this and lay him off for
a few days was that Wormsey thought it his
duty to make up in nerve what he lacked in ginger;
and he was too bashful to tell anyone how
difficult it was to make himself play hard, and
how that he no longer felt springy when he
jumped out of bed in the morning, and that he
slept all the afternoon after practice, instead of
studying, as all football men should.</p>

<p>He went into the field-house the next day, unbuttoning
his coat and hating football. He
hated the ill-smelling dressing-room. He was
sick of training, sick of rare beef and Bass's ale
and bandages and rub-downs, and the captain's
admonitions and the coacher's scoldings. He
thought he would give anything not to be obliged
to play that day. He was sore all over, and his
ear would be torn open again, and he didn't
like having the blood trickle down his neck; it
felt so sticky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>It was a hot, lazy, Indian-summer day; and
his muscles felt exhausted. He felt as much like
exerting them as one feels like studying in spring
term directly after dinner, when the seniors
are singing on the steps. As he came hobbling
out of the field-house he laced his little jacket,
and made up his mind that after the practice he
would tell the captain that he could not spare
the time from his studies to play football, patriotism
or no patriotism. This was not necessary,
because he was tumbled over in the opening
play, and remained upon the ground even
after the captain cried "Line up quickly," with
his ugly little face doubled up in a knot.</p>

<p>"There goes another back," said the scrub
captain, pettishly, snapping his fingers. "Rice,
you play quarter; and Richardson, you come
play half in Rice's place."</p>

<p>Another sub and William, the negro rubber,
picked Wormsey up, the doctor following behind,
and turning back to see the play, which
had already begun again, for he wanted to see
how the new system was working.</p>

<p>As they approached the field-house he saw the
two fellows who had laughed at him the day before
standing apart down at the end of the field.
One of them was tapping his pipe against the
heel of his shoe, and saying, "I didn't know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
that little devil could be hurt. He always&mdash;"
But just then the 'varsity full-back made a long
"twister" punt, and he interrupted himself with
an exclamation about that. It sounded like a
reproach to Wormsey, and he began to feel that
he had somehow gotten hurt with malice aforethought.
And this made him so ashamed that
when they reached the field-house the trainer,
sponging his face, said, encouragingly: "That's
all right, me boy. Don't feel badly. You'll be
out again in a couple of weeks. I've been meaning
to lay you off for a while, anyway. I'll tell
you for why; you're a little stale, Tommy, a
little stale."</p>

<p>Every day now Wormsey trudged down to the
field on crutches&mdash;they had to be sawed off at
the bottom first&mdash;and watched the practice from
a pile of blankets on the side-lines. It was a
fine thing, he told himself, to watch the others
do all the work while he sat still with four 'varsity
sweaters tied about his neck. This was a
great snap; he was still on the scrub, was at the
training table, and would have his picture taken,
would go to the Thanksgiving game free, and
yet did not have to get pounded and pummelled.</p>

<p>He was made a good deal of now. The
coachers patted him on the back and said "My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
boy" to him. He had a lot of sympathetic
adulation from admiring classmates. Upper-classmen
whom he had never seen before, but
who somehow knew him, came up and said,
"How's the leg, Tommy?" At which he hung
his head and sniffled, and said, "Getting along
pretty well, thank you," and then grinned, because
he didn't know whether they were guying
him or not.</p>

<p>In a few days he could walk with a cane, and
he put on his football clothes because they were
more comfortable. He limped after the teams
up and down the field, and squatted down to
see how the 'varsity made their openings, and
he learned how to tell, by the expression of his
legs, on which side the quarter was going to
pass the ball, which nobody else in the world
could tell. Also, by carelessly daily sauntering
into the cage during the preliminary practising,
with a guileless smile on his face, he found out
the 'varsity signals, which he had no business
to find out.</p>

<p>Sometimes he became very much excited during
the scrimmages, and once, when Dandridge,
the wriggly 'varsity half-back, kept on squirming
and gaining after he had been twice downed,
Wormsey screamed, as he hopped up and down
on one foot, "Oh, grab&mdash;grab him! <i>Please</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
grab him! Oh! oh!" so loud that all the field
heard it and laughed at him. Then he realized
what a fool he had made of himself and kicked
himself with his good leg, and limped slowly up
the field to study the next play.</p>

<p>But conceited as it was, he really thought that
he would have stopped that runner if he had
been there. He imagined just how it would
feel to have once more the thrill of a clean
tackle, sailing through the air, and locking his
arms tight, and squeezing hard, and both rolling
over and over, while the crowd yelled in the
distance. And he thought it would be fine to
get out there again, and run his hands through
his hair, and call out the signals, and plunge
the ball home into the back's stomach, and then
pitch forward, and push and strain and sweat
and fall down and get up again. He had a firm
healthy skin now, and had gone up to the tremendous
weight of 138½, which was vulgar
obesity.</p>

<p>One windy sunny day when Wormsey was
limping friskily up and down the field with his
hair blowing about, Stump, the 'varsity quarter,
instead of springing up to his place after one of
the tandem plays, as he should have done, lay
still on the ground, while the college held its
breath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Stump! it's Stump!" they whispered
to one another with scared faces. Then they
no longer held their breaths. They moaned,
and stamped their heels into the frosty ground,
and gazed out sadly toward the dear, frowzy
head of the man who was being carried to the
field-house.</p>

<p>"It's only a wrench," said the doctor. "He'll
be out in a few days."</p>

<p>The captain's mouth grew a little more stern,
but he only snapped his fingers, and said:
"Bristol! No, he's laid off too. Wait a moment,
doctor," he called out. "Is Wormsey
well enough to play?"</p>

<p>"Wormsey?" said Tommy to himself in little
gasps. "Why, I'm Wormsey. What! play
with the 'varsity!"</p>

<p>And the doctor's voice came back through the
wind, "No, I think not."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am!" yelled the shrill voice,
which was heard all up and down both sides of
the field, and reached to the Athletic Club; and
throwing away his cane, and bending over to let
some one pull off two sweaters, Wormsey ran
sniffling out on the field.</p>

<p>"See, Jack," he called to the trainer. "I don't
limp a bit." But he kept his face turned to one
side so that the trainer couldn't see it twitch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here and I'll give you the signals,
Wormsey," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I know them already," said Wormsey, looking
ashamed of himself; and he took his place
on one knee behind the centre who had so
often tumbled upon him.</p>

<p>Then he jumped in and showed everybody
what he had been learning during the past ten
days. He was in perfect condition now, except
for the ankle, which he forgot about. He was
quite accurate in his quick method of passing,
and he tackled ravenously. Fellows like Wormsey
never get soft. "Just watch that boy follow
the ball," exclaimed one of the coachers to
another. "Too bad he's so light," said the
other.</p>

<p>Once when the scrub had the ball they gave
the signal for a trick which they had been saving
up as a surprise for the 'varsity. Tommy
knew that signal. He dashed through the line
between tackle and end, he caught the long pass
on the fly, and having plenty of wind and a
clear field, he made a touch-down unassisted,
which made the crowd yell and applaud. Of
course it was a great fluke, and Wormsey knew
that, but all the same, while the crowd gave a
cheer for Tommy Wormsey, and a three-times-three
for "the little devil," he grinned for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
moment, and puckered up his eyes. But it is
not the crowd that chooses the team.</p>

<p>That evening at dinner all the college was
talking about the great tear the little freshman
had made, and down at the Athletic Club Wormsey
overheard one of the coachers say: "When
Stump comes out again, it'll make him work to
see the freshman putting up a game like that.
But of course he can't keep it up. The pace is
too fast."</p>

<p>Wormsey bit his nails and had his own opinion
about that. But whatever it might have been
was never learned, because the next day he was
taken off the field for the season. His bad
ankle was sprained in the first half, which
served him right for disobeying the doctor's
order. But he should not have cared. Didn't
he play one whole day on the 'varsity?

<h2>WHEN GIRLS COME TO PRINCETON</h2>

<p>If you would like to see a college campus as it
really is, with students walking along with
the gait and the manner and the clothes they
usually wear, and to hear the old bell ring, the
hall and dormitory stairs rattle, the entries echo
and the feet scrape along the stone walks as on
ordinary occasions, and see the quadrangle become
crowded and noisy, then suddenly empty
and quiet again, and if you wish to have a view
of your brother's room in its average state
of order and ornamentation, do not come to
Princeton for one of the class dances, or on the
day of a big game, when everyone is excited
and well dressed, and even the old elms are in
an abnormal flutter, but come down in a small
party some quiet day in an ordinary week, when
there are no extra cars on the small informal
train which jolts up from the junction. Tell
your brother that you are coming, or his roommate,
who will gladly cut a lecture or two and
show you about the campus. Then you may see
the college world in its normal state, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
undergraduate in his characteristic settings&mdash;any
number of him with a pipe in his mouth or
a song, slouching across the campus with the
Princeton gait, wearing something disreputable
upon his head, corduroys and sweaters or flannels
and cheviots upon his body, and an air of
ownership combined with irresponsibility all
over. In short, if you prefer to get some idea
of college life, and learn, as far as a girl can,
why college days are the best of a lifetime, visit
Princeton on some day that is not a special occasion.
But very likely this is not what you
prefer.</p>

<p>Most girls would rather hurry down with a
big trunk in a crowded special train, and go to
four teas, meet a score of men apiece whom
they will never see again, dance all night, and
then, in a few minutes, arise looking as fresh
as they did on Easter Sunday, and smile good-byes
at the depot to the breakfastless young
men whom they leave forsaken and sleepy
to try to go on where they left off, while they
themselves hurry back to town, and to another
dance the next night.</p>

<p>A college dance is generally considered very
good fun. There is an adventurous zest in journeying
to a college, and exploring it, and meeting
crowds of people you never saw before, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
there is something wild and reckless in being
quartered in an odd little boarding-house, or,
more delicious still, in some room in University
Hall borrowed by your entertainer for the occasion,
with the owner's photographs and souvenirs
hanging about just as he left them. Then,
too, the young men themselves, some of whom
you have met or heard of before, try to be very
agreeable, and do everything in their power to
make you have a good time, if for no other reason,
in order that you may see how superior
their college is to any other, so that even several-seasoned
society girls consider it worth
their while to run down to a college dance, and
be amused by these fresh-faced young fellows.
Some of them have been coming off and on for
several generations of college men, and could
talk interestingly of your brother in the class of
'88 should they be so inclined. They know all
about these hops. This is written for you who
have yet to attend one.</p>

<p>There are three regular dances each year, and
they are given by the three upper classes. One
takes place at the close of the mid-year examinations,
to usher in the new term. Another is
given at a more beautiful time of the year, usually
occurring on the eve of some great baseball
game. The third one, the most splendid and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
most jammed, is the sophomores' reception,
given on the night before Commencement to
the class which graduates the following day.</p>

<p>Each class has a dance committee, who fly
around and work hard to make their dance finer
than the last one, and generally succeed. They
procure a fine patroness list to engrave on their
invitations, containing several of the sort of
names that appear in connection with Patriarchs'
balls and Philadelphia assemblies, together
with those of two or three professors'
wives, to lend a tone. The committee get hold
of the Gymnasium, pull down the bars and
draw the trapeze to one side; then have a lot
of pink and white cheese-cloth tacked up, hang
some athletic trophies over the rafters, string a
few hundred incandescent lights here and there,
and send to one of the neighboring cities for a
smart caterer and a large high-priced orchestra
to come for the night. Then they are ready for
you.</p>

<p>Before the dance, however, you are taken to
a few teas which are given by some of the clubs.
You saw the club-houses when you were shown
about earlier in the day. Some of them are
very handsome, and they are all nice, and the
nicest is the one to which your brother belongs,
or whoever owns the club-pin you carry home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
with you. At the teas the rooms are crowded,
the air is hot, the flowers are tumbled over, you
become hoarse, and in most features it is similar
to any tea, except that there are enough men.
You will here meet several of those whose names
you have on your dance-card, and you may
make up your mind whether to remember that
fact or not.</p>

<p>After the round of teas there remain but two
hours in which to dress. When you have hurried
on those things which make up "a dream,"
"a creation," or "a symphony," whichever it is
that you bring, and have had, if you feel like it,
a bit of dinner, you are taken, at a little after
eight o'clock, to church. The Glee, Banjo, and
Mandolin clubs give a very good concert here,
and it is a good place to have your escort point
out the various men who are fortunate enough to
be on your card, and gives you a good opportunity
to notice the taste displayed by other
girls in their costumes, and feel pleased with
your own. There are all sorts of gowns, made
of many sorts of materials with interesting
names.</p>

<p>When the concert is at last over&mdash;much as you
enjoyed it, it seemed rather long to you, who
were thinking of what was to follow&mdash;you are
taken to University Hall, which is across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
street, or to the Gymnasium, if the dance is to
be there, which is a little farther back on the
campus, and you are shown to the dressing-room,
where those last fluttering finishing
touches are put on. Those calm, assured-looking
young women who came in ahead of you are
a little excited too, as is that laughing girl who
was pointed out to you as a flirt.</p>

<p>When you are quite ready, and are pulling
and smoothing your gloves while waiting for
the chaperon to start your party, you catch a
glimpse of something, as the door opens for an
instant, which extends from the door all along
the dimly lighted passage to the very stairs beyond&mdash;something
which looks like a great black
bank with gleaming white patches here and
there. This is made up of young men, whose
collars are stiff and straight. When your chaperon
stalks forth with a sort of flourish, several
members of the black and white bank come forward
to meet your party, and the rest make inaudible
comments upon your appearance, probably
to the effect that you are "smooth." But
all that you are sure of is that your escort offers
you his arm with a smile and a stiff bow, that
you walk nervously up the winding stairs, step
into a dazzle of light, where members of the
dance committee are running hither and thither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
with dance-cards and girls, and where patronesses
are smiling, bowing, looking stately, holding
their fans, and doing whatever patronesses
usually do. Then the orchestra plays a promenade,
to which a few impatient couples try to
waltz, and you begin what you have talked
about and thought about and dreamed about
for a month.</p>

<p>You notice when you have danced the first
one with your brother's roommate, at whose
special invitation you came, that as soon as he
has taken you to your seat he rushes off like
mad. In a moment he comes back again, bearing
with him the young man who was pointed
out to you at the concert as being down on your
card for No. 2. While he is being presented,
still another anxious-eyed man runs up and hurriedly
snatches off your host. These are men
who are "running" girls' cards.</p>

<p>Now, while you and your new acquaintance
are waiting for the music to begin, and are amiably
agreeing that the concert was good, that
the room is warm, that the light effects are
pretty, you may steal another glance at your
dance-card to make sure of this man's name. It
is carefully written in ink on the pretty silk-and-leather-bound
card which was handed to
you on the way to the concert. All the numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
are filled and three extras. This is the way it
was done:</p>

<p>About three weeks ago a young man was sitting
in the grand stand one sunny afternoon
watching the baseball practice, and wondering
whether the nine would beat Harvard, when one
of his clubmates came along and asked him for a
match. He complied with the request, and said,
"Don't mention it." Then the borrower of the
match asked if he were going to the dance, and
as he admitted his intention of doing so, he was
handed a preliminary card which had your
name at the top of it. Then, after a little more
conversation, he put his name down for No. 2,
and handed it back to your host, who thanked
him. And again he said, "Don't mention it."
That was the man who is about to dance with
you. At that time you were unknown to him.
The other names were secured in various ways.
In the midst of a lecture your card was passed
along to some fellow on the end of the row, who,
with the same pencil with which he was taking
notes on "Post-Kantian Philosophy," secured
for himself a <i>deux-temps</i> with you. Other men
were hailed out in front of Old North when the
seniors were singing, or at the club dinner tables,
and in the lounging-rooms when they were
talking baseball, or when they were at the billiard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
table and had to walk across the room to
where their coats were hanging to see their
cards. Perhaps your host took a night off to it,
and went out on the campus and yelled "Hello,
Billy Wilson!" under Billy Wilson's window to
see if he were in before he ran up the stairs to
his room and demanded to see his dance-card;
and went on thus from entry to entry as if he
were out after subscriptions, except that he
went to his friends. Sometimes it is not an easy
task to fill five or six cards, especially when
every one is feeling rather down-hearted over an
unfortunate athletic season. Of course if the
girl has been down before, and is well known
and popular, there is no difficulty of this kind.
Probably the next time you come down you
won't need a card.</p>

<p>Except for the five dances which he saves out
for himself you see very little of your host during
the evening, and even then he seems worried
and absent-minded. It no doubt piques
you a little that the moment the music ceases
he leaves you, and, with an expression on his
face which reminds you of when "Pigs in
Clover" was the rage, darts across the room,
bumping into people and begging pardons. The
only time he looks comfortable and recalls to
your mind last Christmas holidays is when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and you have slipped off to one of those quiet
little nooks so bounteously adorned with rugs
and hangings, brought for the occasion from
some dormitory room, to enjoy two little bits of
ice which he has pillaged from the supper-room.
Then for a while he seems to forget his cares,
and you two have a good old-fashioned chat.
You notice a streak of chicken-salad along his
silken collar, but that gives you no adequate
idea of the muscle and bad language required to
secure and bear away those two little dabs of
ice and one napkin, any more than his anxious
expression indicates the amount of patience and
ubiquity required to "run" three girls' cards at
a college dance.</p>

<p>All this time you have been going through the
several different stages of "a perfectly lovely
time." You have shown a lot of young men
how well you can dance, and have gotten along
very well with all you have met except that
once when you asked sweetly, sympathetically,
"Won't you be just too glad to be a sophomore
next year?" of a very studious and diminutive
member of the graduating class. The chat is no
longer about the concert, nor is the heat mentioned,
though it is terrific, nor the effect of the
lights upon the pink and white cheese-cloth, except
by those gallants who see fit to say something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
about its being becoming to certain complexions.
And, most gratifying of all, you notice
that those who have your name on their
cards more than once come the second time without
being brought. Indeed, some come again
who have not that good fortune, and you pay
slight attention to your card after supper, but
dance with those who come up and beg for a
dance, because you are tender-hearted and hate
to displease them. It is a good plan to lose
your card now or hide it. Some girls tear up
theirs the moment they come, for fear they
might make a mistake, and consequently hurt
somebody's feelings.</p>

<p>By this time you have gotten your second
wind, if you'll pardon the expression. You talk
without previously meditating upon what you
are about to say; but you know it's all right
just as you drift to the strains of the music automatically.
Your eyes are wide open and
sparkling; your cheeks have a flush which is
becoming; you are dimly conscious that your
visit at Princeton is a success. And just as you
are beginning to wish that all this could last forever
you hear a strain of music of which every
daughter of a loving home should be fond, and
then, for the first time, you notice that the
stately patronesses in their bower are opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
their eyes very wide and gritting their teeth
very hard. Then, having danced that last one
furiously, you are dragged off, casting a lingering
glance at faded flowers, wilted collars, tired
musicians, torn skirts.</p>

<p>When you come from the noisy, laughing
dressing-room a moment later, wrapped from
head to foot in a great long thing which covers
any changes the five hours' exercise might have
wrought in your appearance, you are met by
your bedraggled escort under the light, where
you took his arm before, long ago, on the way to
the dance. You can remember how stiff his collar
was then and how smooth his hair. Everything,
animate and inanimate, looks different
now, especially with that ghastly streak of
dawn which mingles with the electric light. It
makes some of the girls look rather faded and
jaded, you think, and some of the men rather
rakish, but not even the girls seem to care very
much. Every one is too excited to be tired, and
too merry to be formal. All the stiffness of
your escort's manner has gone with that of his
collar. As he offers his arm this time he does
not gaze straight ahead of him and murmur
something incoherent about hoping that you are
going to enjoy this, for he begins singing "It's
all over now," to the dank and misty campus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
trees on the way to University Hall, and you
give him permission to smoke a cigarette, and
shout good-night down the stairs, and tell him
what time to call around in the morning&mdash;later
on in the morning&mdash;for he has made you promise
to stay over all of the following day and see
a little of the college and campus, and take a
stroll in the queer old town.</p>

<p>Then, as the gray dawn creeps in through the
dotted Swiss curtains which somebody made for
the freshman who owns the room, causing the
roses on the bureau to look pale and livid, and
while the far-away voices of the dance committee
can be heard from back of Witherspoon,
where they are having an informal game
of baseball in their evening clothes to celebrate
the success of their efforts, and the sparrows
outside your window begin to twitter as though
there had been no dance, you lay your head
upon the pillow and tell your roommate what
the tall one said who danced the two-step so
divinely, and what that funny little fellow with
frowsy hair told you, and what were the remarks
of the football man with whom you sat
out two dances, and how the entertaining man
who sang the solo at the concert seemed to like
you, and what your brother's roommate told you
not to tell.

<h2>THE LITTLE TUTOR</h2>

<p>At first they thought he was one of the new
students, he was such a little fellow and
had such a smooth, boyish face. And one of
the college men had stopped him on the street,
and, in a manner that seemed to indicate that
he had some particular reason for desiring the
information, asked him abruptly: "What class
do you belong to?"</p>

<p>The little tutor had looked up timidly through
his large spectacles and answered, in his thin,
high voice: "I am not a member of any of the
classes. I am to be one of the instructors in
the academy."</p>

<p>He had smiled reassuringly, to show that he
did not take any offence. But the tall young
man did not seem to dream of embarrassment;
he only said: "You <i>are</i>?" and passed on.</p>

<p>This happened early in September, the day
before the term opened, and the little tutor had
been busying himself looking about the campus
and getting his bearings in the little city. He
had never been in the West before, and this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
seemed very far out West; it was like a foreign
country to him. The broad, evenly laid, well-kept
streets lined with so many fine lawns, were
a matter of great interest and speculation. He
thought it queer that when a man could afford
to have nearly a whole block of lawn that he
should have only a frame house upon it, but
some of these frame houses were very large and
comfortable and invariably freshly painted, and
he liked that. He admired the new and handsome
business blocks of fine brick and stone.
But what seemed most wonderful to him was
the broad, level sweep of the prairie when he
walked out into the country. It almost took
his breath away.</p>

<p>But it was the campus, as being his future
place of work, that occupied most of his attention
and curiosity. He walked slowly over it
all, examining each building and every feature
thoughtfully and with a critical air as one about
to buy. There were only about a half-dozen
buildings in all, including both the college and
academy. It struck him as odd that both institutions
should be on the same grounds and
apparently of the same importance. The buildings
were rather new, and he missed the dignified,
patriarchal aspect of the old campus he
had been accustomed to. He thought he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
never feel any veneration for all this brand-newness
as he had toward those old landmarks he
loved so well. Indeed, it all seemed small and
puny viewed in this light, and he walked about
with rather a patronizing air, as he thought with
pride of his Alma Mater, and it seemed to him
that this institution was favored in obtaining for
an instructor a graduate of such a famous old
institution&mdash;and an honorman, too, he said to
himself, with a blush of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of course, this preparatory school teaching
was only temporary with him. Only a preparation
for something else, and that but a step to
something higher, until he became&mdash;but the little
tutor never acknowledged just how high his
ambition aimed. It was at this point, as he was
leaning against a tree, that the young man had
come up and asked him what class he belonged
to.</p>

<p>But he had not minded that in the least; he
knew how boyish-looking he was. It was very
natural for them to make such mistakes. A little
thing like that would not discourage him.
They did not know him; wait a few days, and
they would learn who he was.</p>

<p>And he was right. The whole college and
academy learned who he was the very next afternoon
in chapel. And even the townsfolk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
soon learned to know him by sight; they
thought it odd that such a little fellow should
be a professor. By the end of the month the
children coming home from school had learned
to point out his small figure with the large head,
carried with his peculiar, springing strides, and
they would say to one another, "There goes the
Little Tutor."</p>

<p>But as they watched him walking briskly by,
holding his body stiff and straight, they little
knew what was going on behind that smile,
which was a curious mixture of gravity and good
nature.</p>

<p>For some reason or other things had not gone
as he had expected, and so far, at least, they
were not tending toward the future he had pictured.</p>

<p>He had thought that out there they would
appreciate that he came from such a large, famous
old institution, and that he had stood so
well in his class and all that; but neither the
attitude of the faculty, college, nor academy indicated
anything of the kind, he thought. And
this wasn't all. No one seemed to take any interest
in him as an individual. That is, beyond
a cold curiosity.</p>

<p>He did not see why no one took the initiative
and made friends with him; he could not, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
a new-comer. He knew he had never been very
popular at college, but he had a few good
friends, and nearly every one of his classmates
was kind to him. As he looked back on those
dear old days, midst those dear old influences,
his present surroundings seemed cold, very
cold.</p>

<p>And he could not explain this coldness.
Surely it could not all be on account of that
first mistake. Oh, that terrible first day in
chapel. He thought he would never forget it.
He remembered sitting up there on the platform,
before all the college and academy&mdash;for
out there the whole faculty come to chapel, and
they sit in a semicircle behind the President.
He was conscious of many eyes being upon
him, and he knew what they were thinking and
whispering to each other, "Is that the new tutor?"
"What a kid!" And, indeed, as he
cast his eyes furtively over the faces before him
he discovered even among the preps. many a
raw-boned countryman who was his senior in
years, and this thought had so rattled him that
he took off his glasses&mdash;those large owl-eyed
things&mdash;and began wiping them, as he always
did when embarrassed, and then he suddenly
reminded himself that this always made him appear
more youthful, and so he clapped them on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
again. He had not felt this peculiar lonely out-of-it
feeling for a good many years; no, not
since beginning of freshman year, at his first
eating club.</p>

<p>But what was that? He had heard his name
pronounced. Surely he was not going to be
called upon to lead in prayer. Then the whole
sentence re-echoed in his confused brain, the
distinct clear-cut words of the President, "Horatio
B. Stacy, A.B., will be Professor Wilkin's
assistant in the academy." If any of the bold,
searching eyes had for a moment wandered from
him, he knew they had returned again now.
He remembered wondering if he jumped enough
for them to see him. He remembered how the
steam-heater rattled and pounded in the little
chapel and the odor of the new paint, as the
young President went on with his perfectly
enunciated words in his clear and cold voice:
"He comes highly recommended from a good
Eastern college. I trust he will prove satisfactory.
Let us sing number three hundred and
sixteenth." The President pronounced sixteenth
perfectly. And the organ burst forth
with a loud, cruel prelude, and the hymn was
sung. The little tutor always remembered
number three hundred and sixteen, one bar of
which always seemed to sing "satisfactory."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span></p>

<p>When the long hymn was finished, the
President, having pronounced the benediction,
stepped down from the platform and started
down the centre aisle, followed by an old white-headed
professor, and he by the professor on
his left. The little tutor sat next, and so, innocently
enough, he started down behind them.
How was he to know that there was a custom to
be observed in this trooping out of chapel, that
the order was determined by precedence? Ah,
it made him flush when he thought of it, even
now. He could remember just how the whole
college and academy laughed&mdash;they did not titter,
but laughed outright&mdash;and when he realized
the position and hesitated, trembling, half-way
down the aisle, and tried to smile, some of them
fairly shouted. He could even now see, in his
mind, the face of one of the college men next
to the aisle as he leaned back and laughed
merrily, cruelly, looking squarely into the little
tutor's eyes without pretending to control his
mirth. The little tutor never remembered how
he gained the cool of the outside.</p>

<p>But why was he to be blamed? They should
have told him. How was he to know that there
was any rule about the matter? At his college
the professors never attended chapel; that is,
except two or three, who sat in the stalls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, with some fear and much
hope, he had met his first class. Perhaps his
hand shook a little as he held the roll while
his pupils came into the room, and his voice
trembled, perhaps, as he addressed the class,
and he couldn't help blushing&mdash;his old failing&mdash;when
he heard the laugh caused by his mispronouncing
a queer name; but he told himself
that he had gotten along splendidly when the
long day was over, and the future seemed bright
once more as he planned his work.</p>

<p>He thought out just what his attitude toward
his pupils would be. He was determined that
he would not lord it over them, but would win
their confidence, become friends with them, get
to know them all personally, and invite them
around to his rooms some time, perhaps. He
even determined upon his policy of discipline,
if that should become necessary. He would
not, he thought, be sarcastic with them, as one
of his professors at college used to; no, because
that, he deemed, was taking a mean advantage
of the student, who could not, by reason
of the relations of master and pupil, answer back;
the master had it all on his side. Neither did
he think he would affect the indignant attitude;
no, because&mdash;well, he remembered the fellows'
laugh at him when he once tried to be indignant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
He would assume a dignified disregard,
as the dean used to. That was the best method
of maintaining order and attention in a class-room.
That would best become Horatio B.
Stacy, A.B. He fell asleep that night wondering
what his pupils would give him for a nickname.</p>

<p>Now, as the week went by he never had been
obliged to exercise his authority. The classes
all paid very good attention, better than he had
hoped for. But how very different this thing
teaching was from what he had supposed!</p>

<p>The little tutor had been there almost a
month; he had walked all around the town and
about the country; had faithfully attended all
his classes, and sometimes he had six hours a
day; had gone to chapel every evening at five;
had sat, stared at, in the semicircle behind the
President, and had trooped out again with his
odd gait, and always the <i>last</i> one in the procession
now. But he had not a single friend in
the State, unless it was his landlady with the
false hair front.</p>

<p>He remembered thinking at college that the
attitude of those dear old professors was rather
distant. But that dignified conservatism was
nothing like this unconcern, this icy indifference,
manifested by these professors and assistants;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
and he was one of their number remember,
too.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly as he recollected how that,
when he first came, he had rather expected that
some of them might invite him to dine. This
he deemed would be proper in view of his position
as an assistant, especially as this institution
was so small that the faculty was not large
enough to be divided into many cliques. And
he had even pictured himself enjoying a delightful
conversation with that old, white-haired professor
whom he had taken such a fancy to, or,
perhaps, holding an animated discussion with
some of them as to the respective merits of
Western and Eastern colleges.</p>

<p>But he could have endured their attitude if
only his plans would work in regard to his
classes. It was about his pupils that he thought
the most. He made a study of each man and
each mind and learned what to expect from
each: which were good at one kind of work
and which at another; which were the bright,
indolent fellows and which were the plodders.
They nearly all worked quite hard, that was
the one encouraging thing. But he could not
understand them. The little tutor had never
been to a preparatory school himself, but he
felt certain that these fellows were not like most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
preps. He certainly could not understand their
attitude toward himself. He wanted to be
friendly with them all, and tried to laugh and
joke occasionally to make the relations easy,
but it was of no use, they only looked at him inquiringly,
as if he were doing something they
hadn't bargained for. They all came to recitation
in a business-like way, which seemed to
say, "Here we are, now you teach us."</p>

<p>They never thought of bowing to him as they
came in. They seemed to regard him only as
an automaton that was paid&mdash;and by <i>their</i>
money&mdash;to stand up there and teach, and he
would not have believed that he was thought
of by them outside, that he entered into their
existence at all, if he had not one day come
into the room with rubber over-shoes on his
feet and heard them say something about the
"Little Tutor." That was the time he learned
his nickname, and he felt rather glad when
he heard them say it, though they were somewhat
confused when they turned and saw
him.</p>

<p>When recitations were over, when they had
gotten their money's worth, they returned to
their lodgings in the same brisk business-like
manner, for dormitories are scarce out there.
The little tutor thought perhaps this had something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
to do with the lack of college feeling in
the institution. There was no <i>esprit de corps</i>.
They were, the whole collection of them, college
and academy, simply a lot of young men who
came together in one place, paid their money
and got an education by which they would earn
more than enough to repay them. So you see
it was a good bargain. Perhaps this was putting
it too strongly, he reminded himself, for there
was some feeble exhibition of class spirit once
or twice, and a football team, too, that practised
after supper in their shirt-sleeves. But,
oh! how he longed for a sight of those old familiar
figures he used to see slouching carelessly
across the campus in corduroys and sweaters,
with pipes and songs and all that easy good
friendship, and the practising at the 'varsity
grounds. But these are bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>He hoped that these pupils of his would not
always wear linen shirts. He wished their vests
were not cut so low. He longed for a sight of a
familiar cheviot shirt and a carelessly tied bow
at the neck. He would have given a good deal,
he thought, just to see one man walking by
with a sweater tied by the arms about his neck,
a dirty sweater perhaps, and his hands deep
down in his pockets. Sometimes he felt that he
would enjoy, yes, actually, hearing somebody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
flunk in one of his classes. Who would have
thought that of little poler Stacy?</p>

<p>You see the boy was almost hysterical with
this morbid homesickness. He was brim full of
it, and a very slight jar would have been enough
to upset him and spill it all.</p>

<p>Sometimes he realized that he was making a
fool of himself and then he used to take himself
in hand for being so childish. But he had always
had these little boyish ways of thinking
about the people and things around him. He
remembered how it was at college; when he
first came as a freshman his poor little brain
was nearly worn out with wondering and imagining,
and when he fell to thinking of those days
long ago, it seemed impossible to him that he
was a grown man now and teaching in an academy.
But it was true, and the framed diploma
hung in his room. And, what was more to the
point, he was making money. He had felt encouraged
when he received his first earnings.</p>

<p>On a Saturday evening he had called around
at the treasurer's office and received his money,
carefully counted and put in an envelope with a
blue lining. The treasurer was an old man with
a hard face, and when the little tutor came in he
did not say "How do you do," or anything, but
simply turned toward the safe and took out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
money, keeping the pen in his teeth as he did
so, and only taking it out to ask, as he looked
up at the little tutor, "That is right," in an exact
tone, "is it not?"</p>

<p>He hated this proceeding, and hoped that next
time there would not be the right amount, so
that he might have a cheque. But he felt light-hearted
when he carried the money to his room
and wrote his letter home and enclosed a certain
share of his profits. Prospects seemed brighter
and his hopes ran high, and his dreams ran
away out into the future when all his drudgery
would be over and he would be recognized as a
great man, an authority on&mdash;but somehow it
was hard to hold those old aspirations that had
seemed so realizable about commencement time,
when he was an honor man. This cold western
climate and these common-sense practical New
Englanders seemed to have a chilling effect upon
his ambitions, especially as his self-confidence
was never very firmly rooted, for he was not,
strangely enough for a young man, very much of
a believer in himself, and his conceit was not
spontaneous, but was of the bolstered-up kind,
so that when he halted in his castle-building he
was in a very dangerous position, for, if you
take a young man's conceit away from him, is
he <i>not</i> in a very dangerous position indeed?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>He was also, he told himself, learning this life
lesson: that to win what men call success in this
world required something that he was afraid he
did not possess: he did not know exactly what
to call it. When he was in college he used to
comfort himself with saying: "Never mind, you
may not amount to much here, but when you
get out in the world individual worth will not be
handicapped by modesty." But he was beginning
to despair of this. It would do well enough
in books, but it took what they call <i>bluff</i> to get
along with men, even if you want to do them
good, and this, he knew very well, he did not,
and never could, possess. And when he followed
this line of thought, he used to sigh and come to
the conclusion that what the world called success
was not worth the struggle when one had to use
such man&oelig;uvring to win it. But he reminded
himself that he must not allow himself to sink
into such pessimism, as in his case those at
home had a claim upon him.</p>

<p>It was not at all characteristic of the "little
Stacy" of college days to become so despondent,
for he was of a hopeful, trusting disposition, and
it was all because he had no friend to talk to, no
kindred spirit for his confiding nature, or any
other kind for that matter.</p>

<p>His discouragement took the form of indignation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
in the end, but not before he had several
times taken hope and smiled in his old trustful
way, only to find that it was a blind lead.</p>

<p>For instance when that young Wheaton in his
rhetoric class appeared to be striking up a
friendship with him, and even walked through
the campus several times with him, the chances
of having a friend had seemed fair and he began
to think that at last he was being appreciated
by one fellow, and a nice fellow too. But after
young Wheaton had obtained an extension of
time on the essay he was to write his manifestations
of friendliness suddenly ceased. And the
little tutor wondered how he had offended his
pupil.</p>

<p>Then there was the time he was invited to a
certain annual reception that is always given.
The little tutor knew that he was asked only by
reason of his position, but he remembered accepting
with a good deal of pleasure, and the anticipation
of his <i>entrée</i> into the society of the
town was a matter of no small excitement to
him: a good deal depended on it, he had told
himself. He meditated considerably over the
manner of conducting himself in his first appearance
in society as an instructor: what was becoming
to a tutor, and just how dignified he
ought to appear, and he even found himself practising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
remarks in his room and examining in the
glass the expression of his face and all those old
failings of his self-conscious nature of which he
was so ashamed. He remembered how excited
he was as he rang the door-bell, and how awkwardly
he bowed when he had come down-stairs,
and how little the people restrained their curiosity
in examining him. He did not mingle
with the younger people any more than he could
help, for he always hated young ladies, but
stayed with a group of women who were talking
about Emerson.</p>

<p>These ladies were members of a literary club,
which thought itself very literary and tried to be
Bostonian; and no doubt it was. Stacy had
some very good ideas, and would have been willing
to express them, and could have quoted
readily from an essay he had once written, but
somehow they did not seem to be expecting
anything from him except to smile and say,
"Yes, certainly," now and then, as those two
young assistants were doing, and so he tried to
pick up a low-toned conversation with one of
them on the edge of the circle. But they made
themselves so obnoxious by their air of superiority
that he boldly made some allusion to the
athletic insignificance on the part of their college
in comparison with his own. One of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
immediately made some answer which brought
in something about Yale (at which the other
laughed loudly), and then drew up his brow and
looked complacent, as if he had made a splendid
shot. The poor little tutor turned on his
heel furious, and felt a strange desire to swear,
something that he had never done in all his innocent
life.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion that the fault of
this whole matter lay not in himself, but in
them. This is what he conceived to be the reason:
Nearly everyone in the little city, students,
faculty and townspeople, were New Englanders
by blood or birth. That part of the country,
like other sections of the West, happened to
have been settled entirely by New Englanders.
Perhaps they were not all of the best sort of
New England extraction either. At any rate
no one knew anything but New England ways of
doing things and looking at things, and to the
little tutor, whose environments had not been
such as to cause him to bow down and worship
the Pilgrim fathers, or to think that the sun rose
and set on Plymouth Rock, all this was at first
a matter of surprise, then of wonder, and finally
of hate.</p>

<p>Every day in chapel the President spoke in
his cold tones of character moulding, and held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
up before his hearers Puritan models. On Sundays
the little tutor went to the principal church
of the place, and a kind of essay that seemed to
him nothing but washed-out New Englandism
was thrown out to him. The text-books were
all those of New England writers; all the manners
and customs about the college were copied
after New England colleges; the very compositions
that he had to correct contained allusions
to the Pilgrim Fathers and sturdy New England
character and noble Puritan traits until
the little tutor began to wish that there never
had been a Plymouth Rock. He wondered how
everyone else seemed to stand it so well. But
they had been brought up on it and never knew
anything different, and could not conceive of
any one's not thinking as they did and as their
fathers did and as their great-grandfathers had
done, and pitied (only Stacy doubted if they
could pity) any family that did not have a piece
of the Mayflower to worship.</p>

<p>The most aggravating feature of it, to the little
tutor, was that they were so very self-satisfied
about it all, never dreaming that there could
be anyone so barbarous as not to envy their
New England blood, and it was this attitude
that used to make the little tutor indignant and
cause him to wish he could be sarcastic, as one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
of his professors used to be: how he would pitch
into them! But the worst of it was that he realized
his diminutiveness and his boyishness; so
he felt helpless and baffled, and he had to submit
to the cold indifference and haughty air of
superiority worn by those two young assistants
not much older than himself, who graduated
from such a miserable little unheard-of college.
Stacy thought that if they had gone to his college
they would have had some of the conceit
taken out of them. He thought he might stand
it all as far as he was concerned, but he felt
somehow as if they were insulting his college in
their treatment of himself, her representative.
He blushed to think how poor a representative
he was.</p>

<p>It was just at this point in his discouragement
that he had an opportunity which he had
often longed for. At last he would have a
chance to show them what was in him. This
would be his final stroke, he told himself, and
he staked his all upon it. He was to lead the
prayer-meeting. These prayer-meetings were
attended by the college, the academy, and even
the professors.</p>

<p>Like many excessively shy men, the little
tutor was not abashed before a crowd when he
appeared in some identity other than his own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
At college he had always done well in his orations,
because unconsciously he merged his own
personality into that of an imaginary orator. So
on this occasion he was perfectly cool; indeed,
he was surprised at himself. The subject was,
"Help one another." He had thought, in preparing
it, that it was a singular coincidence, his
having that subject. He thought he could talk
to them from his heart on such a subject. And
he did.</p>

<p>They all listened intently, and he thought
they must be surprised to see how thoughtful
he was, and how earnest, and what a splendid
speaker he was. When he finished, he knew
that he had done well.</p>

<p>He felt almost joyful when he returned to his
room. He dreamed that night that certain men
came up to him as he was walking alone, and
tried to become intimate with him, as he had
seen it done at college with fellows who had
suddenly become prominent.</p>

<p>The next morning he was joined on the way
to the campus by the principal of the academy.
Stacy thought he was going to compliment him
upon his admirable talk. But he was mistaken.
He even hinted about it indirectly, though
ashamed of himself for so doing; but this had
no effect. At last, in desperation, he was going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
to say, "Professor Thorne, may I ask you
whether my talk last evening met your approval,"
but while he was trying to invent some excuse
for such a question they reached the academy
building.</p>

<p>As he took his seat on the platform waiting
for morning prayers to begin (the academy had
prayers as well as evening chapel), he looked
around at the preps. and studied their faces
carefully.</p>

<p>Professor Thorne that morning spoke on one
aspect of character-moulding, namely, "Independence."
He did not directly mention the
address of the evening before, but Stacy thought
he might just as well have, as he sat there beside
the principal before the eyes of the whole
academy without changing his gaze from the
floor or moving a muscle, except once, when the
principal made some reference to the sturdy
New England character; then the little tutor
made a slight involuntary gesture, but no one
noticed it.</p>

<p>That morning in the class-room the little
tutor did not seem himself, and his pupils
watched him curiously. And if the conduct
and appearance of the little tutor was unusual
that morning, what was it in the afternoon!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>At one o'clock, when nearly every one went
down to get the mail, the little tutor was casually
noticed by some of them in the post-office.
"Anything for Horatio B. Stacy?" he asked at
the window in a high voice. Then they noticed
him excitedly tear open the one letter he had
received and, as he ran over the contents, he
said excitedly, in a voice loud enough to be
heard, "Just in time&mdash;just," but at that point
he seemed to notice that he was being observed.
His dazed expression was a curious mixture of
surprise and, perhaps, pleasure.</p>

<p>Then he came in late to his recitation at three
o'clock and seemed to be barely able to keep his
attention on the work, and now and then he
would look up and smile and stare at them in
an indescribably queer way. And in the midst
of the next recitation he suddenly arose and,
motioning the young man that was reciting to
take his seat, he said, in a husky voice, "Here,
stop! the class will please excuse me," and bowing
politely, even grandly, he hurried out of the
room, not seeming to care that his pupils had
not got their money's worth. The little tutor
was not himself.</p>

<p>At half-past seven o'clock that evening he
came promptly to the faculty meeting and
quietly took his customary seat by the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
None of the faculty were aware of anything unusual
until after they had transacted the ordinary
business and had decided one or two cases
that came up, and the president had arisen, as
usual, and said, in his clear tones, "Gentlemen
of the faculty, is there further business of any
nature to come before this meeting?" and the
white-headed old professor as usual had turned
his head sedately around to see if there was anything,
and then settled down in his chair again
with his disappointed look, as was his custom.
At this point the little tutor arose.</p>

<p>No one saw him at first, and the president was
beginning to say "Then the meeting stands adjourned,"
but before he reached the last word
the little tutor cleared his throat with a loud,
forced sound, which made them all, young and
old, turn their eyes upon him. He was smiling,
they thought.</p>

<p>"I think it is about time for me to speak," he
said, in his high voice, with a little nervous tremor
in it.</p>

<p>He was vaguely conscious of this, and, also,
of the light of the lamp reflected upon the blackboard
back of the President's head. Then he
buttoned up his little cut-away coat and began
the speech he had practised in his room. He
spoke slowly and, apparently, very coolly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
in a deep voice which he always assumed in delivering
his orations.</p>

<p>"You are probably aware, as I am, that in the
wording of the letter by which I was engaged to
serve as Professor Wilkins's assistant in your
academy, there was no clause which specifies the
length of time for which I was to serve in that
capacity. This is the case, is it not? A purely
temporary arrangement, so that, in case I proved
unsatisfactory"&mdash;he tried to imitate the President's
pronunciation of this word&mdash;"I need not
be retained the entire year.</p>

<p>"I have been here one month," he said, with
impressiveness. He paused a moment, and then
assuming a smile which he thought was like one
of his old classmates, he concluded: "I appreciate
the delicacy of your position, and will relieve
you of the disagreeable duty&mdash;a duty from
which you have been restrained by your very
kind and thoughtful appreciation for my feelings&mdash;by
voluntarily offering my resignation."</p>

<p>The little tutor walked bravely over to the
desk and bowing low laid a carefully written
sheet of paper on the desk, thereby purposely
allowing an opportunity for expression of opinion.
But he had crossed the room and reached
his place before anyone began to speak; at first
it seemed as if nothing was going to be said on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
their part. Then the President at last made
answer, speaking very deliberately, it seemed to
Stacy:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Stacy, this is very sudden; very
unexpected. We are surprised. Believe me,
Mr. Stacy, in case the performance of your duties
had not been satisfactory, we would have
advised you."</p>

<p>The little tutor believed him.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, your work has been entirely
satisfactory, has it not, Professor Thorne?"</p>

<p>"Entirely," echoed Professor Thorne, across
the room.</p>

<p>The little tutor was baffled by the tones of
the President. He thought they belied his
words. Nobody seemed to be impressed as he
had expected.</p>

<p>"It is my intention to leave to-morrow!" he
exclaimed, excitedly, making an emphatic gesture
with his hand.</p>

<p>"Surely, Mr. Stacy, you are laboring under
some wrong impression. Surely, there is some
misunderstanding. You are a little excited, Mr.
Stacy. Perhaps you are a little overworked.
You had better think it over before you make
up your mind permanently."</p>

<p>Professor Thorne here spoke up: "Don't you
think, Mr. Stacy, that it would be a little unwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
on your own account. Pardon me, Mr.
Stacy, but I understand your circumstances, and
it would be rather late in the year to obtain another
position now."</p>

<p>The President was about to say something
further, but as he turned he saw on the young
man's face a look as of a weak animal at bay;
and he stopped.</p>

<p>"Don't you know why I'm leaving this place?
I'll tell you," he exclaimed, excitedly; all his
oratorical manner and assumed grandiloquence
was forgotten with the rest of his speech. He
almost screamed in his natural voice, "I'll tell
you, <span class="smcap">I hate</span> you&mdash;all, every one." He swept
his hand wildly around the circle, "From the
oldest, gray-haired D.D. to those two conceited
young assistants, you cold, intellectual, cultured,
bloodless, unemotional, self-satisfied creatures&mdash;<span class="smcap">I
hate you</span>. Of course <i>you</i> don't care; you
won't lose anything by my hate." He paused a
moment, buttoned up his little coat and began
again, the words pouring out of themselves: "I
know I'm nobody; I know I'm not attractive, or
cultured, but I'm a human being&mdash;if I'm not
from New England&mdash;and I have a human heart.
I have been here a whole month, and in that
time what one of you has made a friendly advance?&mdash;has
spoken a word of encouragement?&mdash;has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
even taken note of my existence, except as
a machine paid to do a certain amount of work?
I found that out that first day in chapel when
your President told you all of the bargain he
had made. He assured you that you were not
cheated, as the article rented had had a good
standing in his class. I wondered at the time he
did not, in naming my good points like a horse,
mention my college instead of saying <i>a good
Eastern college</i>&mdash;that's what I can't stand. I
could endure the treatment of myself, but those
slurs on my college I cannot and will not stand.
Stop! Don't get excited; don't try to explain
anything. You don't want me to go, because
you think you have a good, hard-working horse.
You think to detain me by informing me of my
poverty. That might do, but&mdash;but read that!"
He snatched from his pocket the letter he had
received that morning.</p>

<p>"<i>Read that!</i>" and he started toward the desk
with the letter in his hand. But the strain was
too much for the little tutor. He fainted for the
first time in his life.</p>

<hr class="l30" />
<p>He never found out whether they read the
letter or not. Of course, he could have ascertained
by writing out there, but he never did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Indeed, he did not like to think of that time
now, though he did love to take out a certain
letter with a printed head at the top and read
the formal language which stated briefly how
that, owing to the fact that Mr. Charles Benjamin
Howard had decided, etc., "the fellowship
in, etc., was open to Horatio B. Stacy as
being, etc., and that it was with a great deal
of pleasure"&mdash;but he knew it all by heart,
because he had intended to repeat it once on a
certain awful occasion when he was, he thought,
temporarily insane, at least not Horatio B.
Stacy.

<h2>COLLEGE MEN</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Johnnie, Johnnie, Dagnan,</p>
<p>Johnnie, Johnnie, Dagnan,</p>
<p>Do you want me?</p>
<p>No, sir-r-ee,</p>
<p>Not this afternoon, 'ternoon, 'ternoon, 'ternoon."</p>
</div></div>

<p>That is what a crowd of noisy, lazy, slouchy-looking
fellows, in a circle in front of Reunion
were singing to a little, old, dried-up man,
with a plaintive face and blue uniform, in the
centre of it.</p>

<p>John Dagnan, chief of college police and envoy
extraordinary to the faculty, cast a sad reproachful
glance at two of the number to whom
he had borne many a summons to appear at
one o'clock, and then relapsed into his characteristic
melancholy silence, gazing inscrutably
into the distance.</p>

<p>Over by the elm in front of the <i>Princetonian</i>
Office were four seniors pitching pennies and
looking very much in earnest over it. Up and
down in front of the shambling old building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
two or three base-balls were flying back and
forth over or against the heads of the loafers
and passers-by. Several other groups were
merely sitting on the steps or standing on the
stone walks, talking or whistling or waiting for
nothing.</p>

<p>The steps in front of the entry door were so
crowded that young Symington, following his
friend Tucker, had to tread upon some of the
loungers to get inside. But the loungers were
used to that and did not stop their conversation.
It's easier than arising.</p>

<p>Symington would have liked to stop and
watch the fellows pitching pennies, and hear
more of the song, and see what the little policeman
was going to do about it, but he did not
say a word. He merely followed Tucker up
to his room and wondered why he failed to notice
it.</p>

<p>Charlie Symington was a well-built prep. boy
who had been known to strike out three men
with the bases full. He had been invited to
spend Sunday in Princeton by some important
athletic men in order that he might see how
much better their college was than all others
in the world. This was because Charles was
young and foolish and had shown signs of shifting
his youthful affections and his future athletic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
brilliance to that other college where two
of his intimate friends were going, and which
had brilliance enough already.</p>

<p>These athletic officials thought that this would
be narrow-minded in him, and they were giving
him a very good time. The way they did it
was not by treating him as a distinguished
guest or by telling him what a fine fellow he
was, which would have turned the little boy's
head and have made him think he could do
as he pleased. They simply said "Come,"
and when he came, let him walk around with
them.</p>

<p>For they were a right conceited lot in regard
to their college, and thought that all they had
to do was put a boy on the campus, let him use
his eyes and breathe the air and get it in his
young system, and his good sense would do the
rest. If it did not, his sense was not good and
they did not want him, thought they.</p>

<p>As for the young pitcher, he did not quite
understand why these great and awful men
whom he had often heard of were so kind to
him, and he did not care. He only opened his
eyes and ears and shut his mouth, and let his
friends do whatever they wanted with him and
thought it was very nice in them.</p>

<p>And that is all I am going to tell of; what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Symington the prep. drank in with his eyes and
ears open and his mouth closed. Nothing will
happen.</p>

<p>A lame arm had laid him off his team for
the usual Saturday game, so he had arrived
in Princeton this afternoon in time to see the
'varsity play with a small college nine. He
watched the game critically and closely, and
passed judgment on each player&mdash;under his
breath.</p>

<p>He knew the initials, age, class, and previous
history of every man on the team, and he could
have told you just what each one did and did
not in the seventh inning of the Yale game
two years before. In regard to the important
games previous to that he was somewhat hazy.
He was only sure of the scores by innings, the
total base hits, and the errors, though he hated
to confess it.</p>

<p>Tucker, the Base-ball president, had honored
him to the extent of allowing him to sit on the
bench under the canopy with the team. Here
was a splendid opportunity of gazing upon their
faces at close range. Once when the third
baseman came in breathless from a home run,
with perspiration running down his face, he
tripped on Symington's toe and said to him in
a loud tone, in order to be heard above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
applause, "Pardon me, Symington," which Charlie
did.</p>

<p>After the game, which was of the subdued,
half-holiday recreation sort, good to bring either
a pipe or a girl to, without fear of putting
either out by inattention, Tucker, the president,
brought him up the street and through the
noisy quadrangle to Reunion Hall where he
now was ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>Tucker opened the door and picked up a
dozen or more letters from the floor and said,
"Sit down, Charlie," and began to assort them.</p>

<p>But he said "Sit down Charlie" in an absent-minded
tone, and Charlie knew that, and so he
looked about the room instead. He thought
this was the kind of a room a college man ought
to have. He gazed at everything in it from the
oar of the last Princeton crew (which must have
rowed in triremes&mdash;there are two hundred and
nine of those oars) to the small photograph of
a girl's face in a dainty little figured blue silk
frame, all alone over Tucker's desk. That was
the first thing he had discovered of which he
could not approve. It grieved him to be obliged
to think that of Tucker. He seemed such
a fine fellow, too.</p>

<p>Just then Mercer, the treasurer, came in with
his rattling tin-box, and talked business with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Tucker, who nodded his head and kept on opening
and glancing through letters.</p>

<p>Symington tried not to listen, but he couldn't
help hearing, so he got up again and went to
the window. A great lot of racket was going
on in the quadrangle below. Somebody had
thrown some water out of a window at somebody
else, and now they were trying to throw
stones back without breaking glass, which was
hard to do. Everyone was shouting or yelling,
or both, and it was echoing from Old North
and College Offices. This is called Horse.</p>

<p>It interrupted Tucker so that he had to raise
his voice and repeat several times what he said
to Mercer. Finally the voices became louder
than he liked. Stepping across the room in a
matter-of-fact way with an open letter in his
other hand, he threw down the window from the
top, with a shrill squeak, and said, in a casual
tone, "Ah, I'm afraid you'll have to be just a
little bit more quiet down there. You're getting
a trifle too noisy. There, that's better," and
went on with his sentence to Mercer, who answered,
"That's so. Shall I wire him about
it?" The racket had suddenly subsided.</p>

<p>Symington the prep. sat down and looked at
Tucker. But the senior changed his expression
no more than when he knocked the ashes out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
his pipe. Charles asked no questions because
he was not that kind of a prep., but he arose,
went to the window again and looked at the
horse-players. Then he looked at Tucker
once more. Most of them were bigger than
Tucker.</p>

<p>They acted as if nothing unusual had taken
place. They were laughing now at something
else, only it was quiet laughter. They were
under-classmen.</p>

<p>The two athletic officers were busy now, the
president talking very rapidly and seriously,
and the treasurer listening intently. Symington,
the prep., gazed out of the window as only
preps. can gaze. He found it interesting
enough.</p>

<p>It was that hour of the day when the undergraduate
leaves whatever has been occupying
his attention, and thrusts his hands deep into
his pockets, and heads for the spot in town
where he feels like going three times every day.
There were dozens of them in sight doing it
now.</p>

<p>The prep. thought it odd, the way some of
them stood still out in the middle of the campus,
and with their eyes turned toward an upper
story of one of the buildings yelled, "Hello-o,
Sam, going down to grub?" or beseechingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
"Please shake it up," or commandingly, "Get
a move up there!" He liked it though.</p>

<p>He could hear footsteps rumbling down the
entry stairs, then the door slam, and then the
man himself would emerge in sight. He saw
them coming out of North, too, and from West,
and he could make out others, way over by East
College. Many of them headed toward Nassau
Street. Some set out in the direction of the
Chapel. Others turned toward the Gymnasium.
Nearly all of them whistled or made a noise
of some sort as they went along.</p>

<p>One fellow, a tremendous man, was stalking
by with his head thrown back, singing at the
top of his voice. But the funny part of it to
Symington was that the big fellow's face seemed
utterly unconscious of whether any one was
around to see him or not. He was all alone,
and he seemed to be having a quiet, comfortable
time of it.</p>

<p>When the clock tolled six Tucker arose and
said, "Now we'll go and get some dinner, Charlie&mdash;Pat,
Symington and I dine at the Athletic
Club this evening. We'll see you later." Pat
was Mercer's right name.</p>

<p>Symington was glad to hear that he was to
dine at the Athletic Club this evening. He had
read all about this affair, and had seen pictures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of it in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. But he listened attentively
to all Tucker had to say on the way
down.</p>

<p>His friend opened the heavy oaken door with
a small flat key, explaining that it was necessary
to keep the doors locked because the mob would
otherwise make themselves at home in there.
"You see, Charlie," he said, "although this is
the training-quarters it is a private club, and
not a public affair like the field-house we were
in this afternoon. But the membership is open
to every one for competition. When you come
to college, if you make the team, you will be a
member as long as you are training with it. If
you become a captain or get any of the Athletic
offices you'll be a life member."</p>

<p>But Symington the prep. was not listening
to that. When the door opened he caught
a glimpse of a big brick fireplace with tiling
over it, on which was inscribed "Oranje Boven,"
and higher up were footballs hung in clusters
with scores painted upon them, and all about
the wainscoted walls of the hallway were baseball
and football and lacrosse championship
banners with gilt lettering. That's what he
was paying attention to.</p>

<p>"Yes, leave your cap there, any place. Now
I want to see what you're good for in this line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
We'll go over the house afterward." Tucker led
the way toward the sound of knives and forks.</p>

<p>Now it should be understood that Symington,
the head man of the school, was not afraid of
anything on earth, and if he were dining at
Prospect with the President of the University, it
would not have mattered. But to walk straight
into a room and be introduced to the captain of
the team was a little too much. It took his appetite
away at first, and he thought he could eat
none of that famous training food of which he
had heard. However, the shock soon passed.</p>

<p>He was presented to all the members of the
nine, and to the subs and to the trainer, and also
to two professional pitchers from the Brooklyn
League team, who were down to coach the players,
and who were just now eating with their
knives a huge meal at a little side-table.</p>

<p>Symington was given a seat next to Jack, the
trainer, who was cordial and kind to him, and
said, "Oh, me boy, you must eat more than that."</p>

<p>The meal seemed to be a very business-like affair.
The men were brown from their exercise
in the sun, and ruddy and glowing from their
recent rub down, and hungry from both causes,
and they devoured great sections of rare beef
as though they knew it was their duty to get
strong for Old Nassau.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>The conversation was quite shoppy. When
he had finished, the captain pushed back his
chair from the table and said, "Fellows, you
played a pretty good game to-day. But we've
got to brace up in team work. When a man's
on a base we must simply push him the rest of
the way around."</p>

<p>As soon as dessert was finished, Tucker said,
"I want to smoke. Let's start up for the singing,
Charlie."</p>

<p>Symington would have liked to explore the
rest of the club-house, though of course he did
not say so. He did not even ask what the singing
meant. But as they arose to leave the table
he did ask a question about one of the portraits
of the ancient and modern athletic heroes which
line the walls.</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie," said Tucker, "that's he."</p>

<p>"I remember just how he looked when he
made that long, low drive, that time, in the ninth
inning," Symington said, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tucker, briefly, "a great many of
us will always remember his long, low drives.
Here is your cap."</p>

<p>This was in reference to a large portrait at the
end of the room. The frame had a deep black
border.</p>

<p>Tucker and his friend, the other fellow, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
University treasurer, whose name the prep. had
forgotten, waited until entirely out of the house
before lighting their pipes.</p>

<p>Two or three of the team joined Tucker and
Symington and the University treasurer. The
prep. felt that one of them was coming up
beside him. He waited a moment and then
glanced out of the corner of his eye. He
caught his breath, but did not fall down. It
was the captain of the 'varsity nine.</p>

<p>It's a very fine thing to be head man of your
school and pitcher on your team, but oh, if the
school could see him now!</p>

<p>"How do you like our club?" asked the
captain in a voice something like other men's.</p>

<p>"I like the club," said Symington.</p>

<p>"Yes, we think it's a pretty comfortable
place. Come down to-morrow and we'll show
you the Trophy-room and all." Then he began
to question him about his team at school.</p>

<p>To Symington's surprise and delight the
captain seemed to know the score of all the important
games they had played and how many&mdash;or
how few&mdash;base hits had been gained in
each one off him, Charles Symington. And he
can tell you to this day every word of the conversation
and at what point of the walk it was
when the captain said, "Well, you are pitching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
pretty good ball this year. This is McCosh
walk. Look at those trees."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Symington.</p>

<p>The soft evening light was sifting down
through the interlacing branches, making a
glow to dream about, which Symington did not
notice. He had no time to waste at present.</p>

<p>They passed between Chapel and Murray
Hall and across back of West toward North.
Just as they reached Old Chapel strange notes of
music broke in on the prep.'s ears. At first he
could not make up his mind whether it was
vocal or instrumental, or whether it was real at
all, in fact, or part of a dream like everything
else perhaps. The seniors were singing, and
from that part of the campus it echoes oddly, as
you doubtless know.</p>

<p>When they turned the corner and were on the
front campus a wonderful sight met the prep.'s
eyes. On the steps of Old North, and spilling
over upon the stone walks in front and filling up
the window casements on either side, was the
senior class in duck trousers and careless attitudes
with the dark green of many class-ivies
for a background and the mellow brown wall of
the ancient pile showing through in places.
Most of the fellows had an arm about one or
two others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>One of the number was standing up in front
beating time with a folded <i>Princetonian</i>. They
were singing a dear old song called "Annie
Lyle." Their voices came rich and sweet in
the twilight air.</p>

<p>Under the wide elms were the rest of the college.
Also the poor post-graduates and some of
the faculty's families and the little muckers, and
even a few seminary students from over the way.
But only the undergraduates seemed becoming
to the scene. The others rather spoiled the
effect.</p>

<p>Some of the fellows were sprawled out flat on
their backs looking up through the tree-tops at
the fading blue. Some rested their heads on
each other and got all mixed up so that no one
could tell which were his own legs. Others were
strolling about or looking at the strangers who
came to spend Sunday or to see the game. A
few were passing tennis-balls and being cursed
by the rest. All of them wore négligé clothes or
worse.</p>

<p>The captain said he did not feel like singing
and led Symington across in front of the seniors
and made him sit down beside him on the
grass. This was in the eyes of the whole University.</p>

<p>Symington was quite near the men on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
steps. He looked them over and tried to catch
the joke they were all laughing at now the song
was finished. He thought it would be a right
fine thing to sit up there and sing to a college.
And he made up his mind that if he ever did it
he would climb up on top of one of the lion's
heads like that little short fellow with the long
pipe.</p>

<p>After singing "Rumski Ho" in long, measured
cadence, and other good old things and several
new ones, some one on the steps began shouting,
"Brown! Brown!" Several voices said, in concert,
"We <i>must</i> have Brown." Out in the crowd
they began crying, "Right! Brown. We want
Brown! We <i>must</i> have Brown!"</p>

<p>Three seniors lay hold of one senior and lifted
him to his feet. Symington could hear him saying,
"Don't, don't. I'm a chestnut. They won't
listen to me any more. Please don't make a
fool of me, fellows." But he was made to stand
out in front and sing a solo.</p>

<p>While this was going on the rest of the college
jumped up from their places and pressed up into
a close semicircle about the steps. Symington
and the captain had to arise to keep from being
trampled on.</p>

<p>When Brown finished his solo he was applauded
so much that he had to sing another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
and Symington made up his mind that next to
being the captain he would most like to be
Brown.</p>

<p>Then the crowd called for "Timber," and a
man got up who had the queerest face Symington
ever saw. He looked as if he were trying
with all his might to look serious and would
never succeed. Everyone began to laugh the
moment Timberly stood up, especially his own
classmates. And when he began to sing his
comic ballad they laughed still more.</p>

<p>When he finished, the audience clapped their
hands and yelled. A crowd of juniors gave the
college cheer and ended with the words "Timberly's
Solo." In some respects Symington
liked Timberly more than Brown.</p>

<p>When Timberly at last, looking sad, sat down,
Symington heard several voices saying "Everybody
up." Those on the ground arose, and
those in the windows jumped down. Symington
got up too, though he did not know why,
and took off his cap when he saw the captain
do it.</p>

<p>It was late twilight. The campus was becoming
dusky. The faces were dim. The ball-throwing
had ceased, and the little muckers had
left. The elms were sighing softly overhead
in a patriarchal sort of way. Symington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
thought everyone seemed more quiet and solemn
than they were before. Perhaps he only
imagined it.</p>

<p>Then, with all the seniors on their feet, with
their heads uncovered, the leader waved his
white baton, and over one hundred voices sang
"Tune every heart and every voice, Bid every
care withdraw," and the rest of the college
hymn.</p>

<p>Many of the audience joined in, and nobody
thought it fresh in them; and Symington would
have liked to join in too, only he did not know
how. He felt very queer for some reason, and
forgot who was standing beside him for a moment.
The poetry of the scene was getting into
him. He didn't know that, of course, but he
had a vague feeling that this was living, and
that it was good for him to be there.</p>

<p>When the hymn was finished the class cheered
for itself and for the college, and for itself again;
and the senior singing was over.</p>

<p>From all over the front campus there suddenly
broke out in many loud discordant keys,
"Hello, Billy Minot" and "Hello, Jimmy Linton"
and "hello" Johnnys and Harrys and
Reddys and Dicks, and Drunks, and Deans,
and Fathers, and Mables and horses and dogs
and houses and others. As each found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
man he wanted, an arm or two was thrown
about a neck or two, and they started off for
some other part of the campus or town.</p>

<p>The captain had also helloed for someone.
Symington was left alone for a moment. But
he was not exactly alone. He listened to the
scraps of talk as the fellows moved past. "Pretty
good singing this evening.... Get to
work now.... At Dohm's.... I told
him to come up.... New York to get advertisements....
The Trigonometry.... Trials for the Gun Club.... <i>Princetonian</i>
Subscriptions now.... The mandolin to
some girls that came to see the game with him....
You damn sour ball." Some of them
were humming the last notes of the song. Others
were saying nothing.</p>

<p>A loud clear voice beside him called "Hello,
Charlie Symington." It was Tucker looking
for him in the dusk, and he called him just as
they called to college men. Symington was to
meet the captain again later on. Tucker put
his arm about Charlie's shoulders as they
stepped along toward Reunion. Perhaps he
did it unconsciously.</p>

<p>"You can amuse yourself with these," said
Tucker, tossing into Charlie's lap a copy of the
<i>Bric-a-Brac</i>, which he had read long ago at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
school, and a lot of photographs. "And if you
want a nap," he added "just read that." He
threw across the room the last number of the
<i>Nassau Lit</i>. That's a very old joke.</p>

<p>Tucker then turned to his desk and got to
work over something. Symington did not know
what it was, and of course did not ask. But it
was not fifteen minutes before "Hello-o, Tommy
Tucker" came in a loud voice from the quad,
below. Tucker frowned and did not look up.</p>

<p>Then it came again, with a sharper accent on
the second syllable, "Hell<i>oo</i>, Tommy Tucker."</p>

<p>"Hello," Tucker replied, shortly.</p>

<p>"Are you up there?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm down at the 'varsity grounds running
around the track."</p>

<p>"You busy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ted, I am. Don't come up."</p>

<p>"All right." Then a whistled tune began,
and the shuffling of a pair of feet along the
walk. Gradually they faded and mingled with
other whistling and feet scraping.</p>

<p>While Symington was thinking this over he
heard another voice calling for someone else,
and when a muffled response came back, the
clear, outside voice said, "Stick your head out!"
He heard a window lowered and the inside
voice say "Well?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>"Stick it in again."</p>

<p>The window slammed and the man below
went on down to Dohm's, whistling softly to
himself.</p>

<p>Symington, the prep., thought that was very
funny and laughed aloud, and hoped he did not
disturb his host by so doing.</p>

<p>Presently someone else yelled for Tucker, and
when he replied, "Yes, of course, I'm busy," the
man below called back, "Too bad," and the entry
stairs began to clatter. In a moment a
broad smile and a pair of clean duck trousers
burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Timberly," said Tucker, smiling in spite of
himself, "I thought I told you not to come up
here this evening."</p>

<p>"I believe you did. That's so." Timberly
was trying to look serious. Then brightening
up at the sight of Symington as if remembering
something. "But you see," he said, "I wanted
to meet the pitcher." Tucker grinned and introduced
them.</p>

<p>Timberly shook Symington's hand vigorously
and said, "Wasn't that a smooth song I sang on
the steps&mdash;hey? I'm a good one, only none of
'em appreciate me. Oh, yes, I nearly forgot&mdash;I'm
up here on business. I'm up here on business,
Tommy Tucker," he repeated, and daintily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
kicked off Tucker's cap and disappeared into
one of the bedrooms. Tucker kept on working.
Symington wondered what Timberly was
doing.</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past eight now, and other
fellows began dropping in. Some helloed first
and some came unannounced. Tucker looked
up to see who they were. Sometimes he said
"Hello" and sometimes he did not. Some of
them took off their caps. Others did not.
Tucker left it to the first ones to introduce
Symington to the later ones.</p>

<p>After half an hour's absence Timberly
emerged from the room finishing a sentence he
had begun before he opened the door. "And
Tommy, you must do the rest. You can tie
them so nicely too."</p>

<p>"Tommy, look," said the man with the banjo
on the sofa.</p>

<p>Timberly was standing up straight, nicely incased
in evening clothes and holding two ends
of a white tie in his hands. He looked well-groomed
and seemed like a different man now.
Perhaps he was.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" said Tucker, in a
stern voice.</p>

<p>"I've got to do it. It's two years now, and
it's not good form to let a dinner call go more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
than two years in Princeton. Here, Tommy,
fix this."</p>

<p>"Do it yourself."</p>

<p>"These were great friends of my brother's,
and he made me promise on the Family Bible,
if we have one. Here, tie this. Great Scott,
I've done all the rest. They are your own
clothes. You ought to at least be willing to fix
the tie."</p>

<p>Tucker put his pen between his teeth and
tied the knot with Timberly kneeling at his feet
like a patient child having his face washed.
Tucker was one of the three men in college who
could make a decent job of a tie on another
man's neck without standing behind him. The
others looked on in silence. Timberly looked
up and winked at the prep.</p>

<p>As a rule Symington did not like people to
wink at him, as though he were a boy, but this
was a most peculiar wink. He not only liked it
but nearly snorted out with laughter, which
would have been a very kiddish thing to do.</p>

<p>Timberly jumped up. "You're a pretty nice
fellow, Tommy Tucker, even though you are
arrogant," he said, and leaned over and rubbed
his chin affectionately across Tucker's nose,
then grabbed his cap and started for the door.</p>

<p>"By the way Timber," said Tucker. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
want you to return those clothes some time.
Do you hear? I may go out of town next week."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable," replied Timberly,
reflectively rattling the knob as he glanced
about the room at the others.</p>

<p>"And I don't want to chase all over the
campus for 'em. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Now, Tommy Tucker, you talk as if I were
accustomed to keeping things I borrow. What
are you fellows laughing at? Besides, you know
very well, T. Tucker, that even if I should
happen to forget to return your suit, all you
would have to do would be to wire down home
for mine&mdash;or, no, ask me and I'd wire down myself
and save you the trouble." He banged the
door.</p>

<p>"Now do you suppose," laughed the one with
the cigar on the divan as Timberly's feet in
Tucker's patent leathers went pattering down
the stairs, "that Timber thought he was in
earnest in that last brilliant remark of his, or
was it meant for horse." You could seldom tell
with Timberly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he knew himself," said the
man with his feet on the arms of Symington's
chair. "He's on one of his streaks to-day. I
saw the symptoms this morning in Ethics. And
when he's that way he's as good as crazy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>"Right," said the one with the banjo. "He
don't know what he's saying any more than he
knows that he has a cap on his head with a
dress suit. If he were in his right mind he
would not go out calling."</p>

<p>"He'll either make a fool of himself this
evening wherever he goes, or else he'll make
one of those great tears of his."</p>

<p>But Symington the prep. thought Timberly
was about the best fun in the world.</p>

<p>Some of the fellows left and others came in.
Symington thought some of them behaved oddly.
One man seemed very sour and came in scowling
and sat down without saying hello to anybody.
He put his feet on the table and pulled
his cap down over his eyes. As soon as he
finished his pipe and had emptied the ashes on
the carpet to keep out the moths he arose and
stretched himself and went away again. He
had not said a word. And after he had left no
one said anything about it.</p>

<p>That happened while the crowd was thickest.
When there were only a few fellows in the room
some one generally remembered to introduce
the incomers to Symington. He rather liked
the way they treated him. They did not, as a
rule, patronize him because of his being a prep.
And they did not take pains to make him feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
at ease, which would have rattled him. They
treated him more as if he were one of them, and
talked to him, if they felt like it, and let him
look after himself, if they did not. At least
that is the way it seemed to Charlie. And they
called him Charlie or Symington, without any
Mister, which would have made him feel ridiculous.</p>

<p>And all this time Tucker at his desk kept on
working and only looked up occasionally to
say, "How are you, Willie, there's the tobacco,
come in." The only time he arose from his
seat was once when Jack the trainer came in,
and looking at the crowd said, "Mister Tucker,
can I speak with ye a moment." The busy man
said "Certainly" and led the way into his bedroom
and closed the door with a bang, and came
out again in a few minutes saying, "All right
Jack, I appreciate your position. I'll see to it.
Good-night," and sat down to work again.</p>

<p>At a little before eleven the prep. began to
feel the force of training habits. He was gritting
his teeth hard to keep from yawning.
Tucker, who had not looked up for nearly an
hour, whisked his papers and things to one side,
slammed two drawers, turned a lock, and suddenly
jumped up from his chair. He ran across
the room with a yell which startled the prep. and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
made the chandelier ring. Then he threw himself
upon two fellows on the divan and began
calling them names. His teeth were set and his
face so fierce that the prep. found it difficult to
keep from believing him angry. And then the
two on the divan arose in their might and cast
him upon the floor, exclaiming, victoriously,
"There, be Gosh." Tucker was through his
work for the week and was feeling glad about
it. That was his way of expressing it.</p>

<p>"Now, Charlie," he said in a loud, careless
manner, "we go out and have some fun now.
Here's a cap. Don't wear that ugly stiff hat
any more. See?"</p>

<p>Symington had no idea where he was going,
but he arose and said good-by to the three
others in the room. They did not seem to feel
badly in the least over their rude treatment on
the part of their host. One of them, sitting on
a table with one foot on a chair and the other on
the floor, was reading a book of verses and did
not look up when Tucker said, "So long." The
other two, who had been talking about the baseball
prospects and including Symington in their
conversation, remained flat on their backs talking
about the baseball prospects without Symington.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening. In other words it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
was spring term and the night was clear. There
were still groups of fellows seated on the doorsteps
or stretched out under the trees. The
gleam of their flannels could be seen in the
dark. They were up in the balconies also. One
of them knocked the ashes from his pipe and
Symington saw the sparks float down. He
heard a low laugh come from one of the wide
open windows. Up from Witherspoon came the
tinkle of mandolin music. They were playing
to some visiting girls on those broad balconies
in front.</p>

<p>"This is West," said Tucker; "Jack Stehman
lives in that room up there and Harry
Lawrence in the one below&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Stehman the tackle?" asked the prep.</p>

<p>"Yes. Have you met him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You will to-night."</p>

<p>The prep.'s heart gave a bound. He was to
meet Stehman.</p>

<p>They passed down by Clio Hall and dingy
Edwards and turned toward a long gray building
a little to the left.</p>

<p>"This is Dod Hall," Tucker said, and opened
one of the big doors.</p>

<p>They went up two or three flights of stairs
and turned down the hall, and Tucker kicked a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
door at the end of it. Something clicked and
the door opened of itself. Four or five voices
shouted, "Come in."</p>

<p>Mingled bits of conversation and tobacco
smoke and the odor of lemon-peel met them in
the little hall-way as they entered it. But Symington
the prep. looked behind the door and
made up his mind that his door would have an
electric apparatus like that when he came to
college.</p>

<p>A fellow stuck his head out of one of the bedroom
doors and pointing across the hall-way
to the main room with a long, bright deer-knife,
said, "Come in, Tom, I'll be there in a moment."
He rubbed perspiration from his brow
with the back of the hand which held a lemon
and disappeared into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Yea-a-a!" cried several voices as Tucker
pushed back the portière and stood in the door-way.
"Come in, Tommy," they said. "Come
in, Symington," said one of the fellows that
knew the prep.</p>

<p>"Fellows, this is my friend Symington, the
prep.'" said Tucker; "Symington, this is de
gang." Tucker tossed his cap and Symington's
gracefully into the scrap-basket and pushed
Charlie into a seat on the sofa. A fellow with
spectacles began asking him what he thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
the afternoon's game. The prep. did not know
the man's name, but that did not matter.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen fellows scattered
about the room, but the thing that attracted
Symington's attention was in the centre of it.</p>

<p>Two square-topped desks had been placed
end to end. On these lay a table-cloth, or rather
some sheets, and on them was stacked a pile of
things good to look at and better to eat. The
only reason the food did not immediately become
part of the dozen fellows was because they
were waiting with watering mouths for something
to wash it down with. And this was being
prepared as rapidly as Randolph and Ashley in
the bedroom could do it. Perhaps they were
trying to do it too rapidly, for Symington
heard a voice exclaim, "Aw, look out, you ass,
you're spilling it all over my bed."</p>

<p>While they were waiting, Dougal Davis and
Reddy Armstrong and Harry Lawrence and
Jim Linton and others came in. When the
lounge, window-seat, chairs, tables, and coal-scuttle
became crowded, the new-comers sat on
the floor.</p>

<p>Presently the introductory strains of Mendelssohn's
"Wedding March" came from the bedroom,
followed by Randy and Dad Ashley and
two assistants bearing aloft two basins, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
seemed to be heavy. They strode in, swinging
their feet far out in front in a stagey manner to
the tune of the "Wedding March" which they
shouted with their heads thrown back.</p>

<p>Hunter Ramsay jumped up and marched behind
them. The rest thought this a good idea
and did likewise, and all sang loud and stamped
hard and made the poler growl in the room below,
which did no good. Then after marching
twice around the table they carefully set the
bowls down at either end of it with the ice tinkling
against the sides. One of the bowl-bearers
remarked, "Maybe you don't think those
things are heavy."</p>

<p>"Now then!" said Stehman the tackle, approaching
the table. "Ah!" said Symington's
friend Tucker. The others may have said
things also. If they did not they looked them.</p>

<p>No one waited to be asked. Everyone was
supposed to know without being told what was
the object of white breasts of cold chicken with
russet-brown skin, and rich Virginia ham with
spices sticking in the golden-brown outside fat,
and little, thin, home-made sandwiches and
olives and jellies, Virginia jellies, you know, and
beaten biscuit and chocolate cake and fruit cake,
or black cake, as they call it in the South. As a
matter of fact they all did seem to know, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
this included Symington, who held his own
with the others very well for a little prep. boy
in training. He had forgotten to be sleepy
now.</p>

<p>Thus began one of the greatest evenings in
the life of Charlie Symington, and it lasted until
two o'clock. It was an old-fashioned spread.
There was no caterer with a gas-stove in the
bedroom, or a table set with a bank of flowers
down the centre, or properly attired waiters
opening wine behind the chairs. Randolph's
mother had sent up a lot of deliciously cooked
stuff from the old place in Virginia. Randolph
had said to some of the fellows, "I've got a box
of grub. Can you come 'round this evening?"
And by the looks of things most of them had
found that they could as well as not.</p>

<p>Symington had the best time of them all, and,
besides, he learned much. He noticed that
quite as many fellows took lemonade as drank
punch, and this was a matter of surprise to
the prep. For his ideas of college men were
largely drawn from would-be sportive young
freshmen that drove through prep. school
towns waving beer-bottles overhead and beating
their horses into a gallop.</p>

<p>Nobody got drunk. Everyone became livelier
and brighter and better, but that is the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
such gatherings, and those who confined their
attentions to the lemonade end of the table were
as noisy as the others. No one was urged to
take the red fluid rather than the yellow. In
fact no one observed which fellows visited
which punch-bowl. No one but Symington.
And he had been under the impression that at
college a fellow's jaws were pried open with a
baseball bat and rum was poured down his
throat, while three other men held his legs and
arms.</p>

<p>The room had now become beautifully hazy
with smoke. Some of the fellows tipped their
chairs back and put their feet up. The window-seat
was full to overflowing. One man rested
his head on another fellow's shoulder and asked
him to muss his hair. The legs of the one having
his hair mussed stretched out over the legs
of two other fellows and intertwined with those
of a third. Two men were sitting beside the
oranges on the table. Some were on the floor
with their backs against the wall. All had full
stomachs and light jovial spirits. Symington
was watching Dougal Davis blow rings.</p>

<p>Harry Lawrence started up "The Orange and
the Black." They sang all the stanzas. Then
they sang more songs, old songs which are still
popular and new songs which were then popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
and are now quite forgotten, probably.
Everyone sang, whether he knew how or not.
Symington sang too. The one he liked the best
was a funny song beginning, "Oh, to-day is the
day that he comes from the city." They sang
that one over and over again. Then they sang
it once more. They were all having a good time.</p>

<p>After a while the room became quiet and
someone turned down the lights and they told
ghost stories, which frightened the prep.</p>

<p>They wound up the evening by trooping downstairs
in the dark, for the lights were turned out
long ago, and marching up to the front campus,
singing as they went. And there they danced
about the cannon and sang and whooped and
yelled until Bill Leggett came over with his lantern
and said, in his gruff voice and good-natured
manner, "Boys, it's nearly Sunday morning."</p>

<p>"All right, Bill," they answered. Then all
said good-night and went to bed.</p>

<p>Tucker had a roommate some place, but
Symington had his bedroom that night.</p>

<p>"If you want anything, just yell for me, Charlie.
My room is right next, you know. Goodnight."
Tucker was half undressed.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't want anything. Wait a minute,
Tucker, please. I'm not sure about something,
and it bothers me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Princeton won the football championship
in '78, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"Say that again."</p>

<p>"Didn't we win in '78?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie, we did."</p>

<p>Symington thought his friend Tucker was
smiling at his ignorance. But that wasn't it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<h2>THE MAN THAT LED THE CLASS</h2>

<p>The Latin salutatory was finished. Dougal
Davis bowed and took his seat and the
applause began.</p>

<p>He had done well and he knew it, but he did
not stop to dwell upon that now. There would
be plenty of time to feel pleased with himself
later on. At present his chief sensation was of
jubilant relief at telling himself that the thing
was over with at last.</p>

<p>Not many of his audience had understood
much of what he had been saying, but that did
not matter. The fellows smiled at the right time
when he said something about <i>puellas pulchras</i>,
and they nodded their heads knowingly when
he made the reference to athletics, as he had
told them beforehand to do. And he had gotten
through without forgetting the paragraph beginning
with "Postquam," as he feared he would.</p>

<p>He was mopping his good-looking brow. His
nerves were still quivering, but he felt perfectly
cool and unafraid of anything, and he sat very
still with his eyes half closed, and felt the tension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
on his nerves soothingly relax. Then for
the first time he heard the applause, and it occurred
to him that all those many people out
there were clapping their hands for him, and
that for five minutes they had heard very little
else but his voice, and he felt without glancing
up that they were still looking at him and very
likely thinking, "That is the man that led the
class." He told himself all this with an inward
smile of wonder at his own importance, and at
his not being more impressed by it.</p>

<p>Then he slowly raised his eyes and moved his
gaze around over the many fluttering fans to the
right. He passed over it once without seeing
it, then he found the face he was searching for.
She was looking up at him with just the kind of
a smile that he knew would be there, and when
she caught his eye, the smile became radiant, and
he fancied he saw a little look of triumph in it.
This he answered with a shrug of his engowned
shoulder and an almost imperceptible grimace,
and quickly looked away again. No one else
saw it, but she saw and she understood.</p>

<p>The applause had ceased, and the next man
was introduced and the audience turned their
attention to him.</p>

<p>Davis took a long breath and looked about
him. There was a fat old lady fanning vigorously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
and at every stroke of the fan a ray of
light was reflected in his face. Over there on
the right of the platform were the venerable
trustees. Harry Lawrence's fine looking father,
with the handsome head of gray hair, was in the
front row, looking grave and indulgently interested.
On the left were the faculty in their
black gowns. They appeared more or less accustomed
to all this. Down in front were his
classmates, and back of these the many, many
people closely crowded together. Their faces
looked like little patches of white with dark
marks for features, and nearly all of them
seemed to be fanning.</p>

<p>He remembered the lining up under the elms
this morning in front of North, and the band
that played, and the girls that gazed, and the
many classes calling "'82 this way!" and "'61
this way!" and the old-fashioned cheer that '79
gave. Then with the band taking a fresh hold
on the air, how the long procession had begun
its march under the trees toward the church, between
the crowds of visitors who parted to either
side and looked at them as they filed by.</p>

<p>First came that member of the faculty who is
always grand marshal and carries an orange and
black baton, then the august trustees followed
by the faculty in their gowns and mortar boards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and behind these trooped the sons of Nassau;
each class in the order of graduation, and last of
all those who were about to become graduates,
over whom all this fuss was being made, and who
were somewhat impressed by it and by the length
of their gowns.</p>

<p>He remembered the slow, dignified march led
by the grand usher and his assistants up the aisle
of the old church between the crowded pews of
smiling fathers and proud mothers and the girls
with bright-colored dresses. He recalled how
amused and yet pleased he was at hearing a
junior whisper to a girl beside him, "There he
is&mdash;that's Davis, the one I was telling you
about." This he remembered had interrupted
the silent rehearsal of the sentence with the
ablative absolute in it. But he did not have to
rehearse it any more. All the salutatorian had
to do was to sit still and hear what the other
speakers had to say and feel good.</p>

<p>He was thinking about himself and the four
years just past, and having a right good time at
it. He recalled how he had been a nobody
at the start, and he smiled as he remembered
how some of these very fellows in the pews before
him had looked down on him in freshman
year, and how he had forced their respect and
won their liking. He traced the progress of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
from the first step when he gained the one freshman
position on the <i>Princetonian</i> board and
overheard someone say, "What! that poler?"
up to the present time when people pointed him
out on the campus and said, "There goes Dougal
Davis." Few ambitious men graduate with as
much to be proud of and as little to regret.</p>

<p>First there was the prize for leading the class
in freshman year, then came the sophomore
essay prize, and the Washington's birthday debate,
and the next year a classical prize and two
or three Hall honors, including one of the four
appointments for the inter-Hall junior oratorical
contest, in which he had won first place, and a
number of other prizes of which he did not stop
to think in detail, and finally the appointment as
first representative of his Hall in the Lynde debate
which had taken place the night before, and
the result of which would be announced to-day.
Intermingled with these were other honors, such
as the membership of an elective club, and the
presidency of his class in junior year, and the
class oratorship on Class Day, and then the
Latin salutatory to-day.</p>

<p>You see he had just about all one man could
get, and before he left the room he was going to
hear his name read out before everybody, as the
winner of still a few more honors. This was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
culmination of a rather successful career, and he
told himself that he did not care how conceited
it was, he was going to enjoy it for all it was
worth, for before the sun set he would be an undergraduate
no longer, and there would be plenty
of time to find how small he was.</p>

<p>Dougal Davis was the son of a foreign missionary,
and he had entered college with the intention
of making a minister of the Gospel of
himself. He still had that intention. He was
one of the most popular men on the campus.</p>

<p>When he began his course he was as bristling
with prejudices and as redolent of sanctimony
as many high-minded young men of noble purpose
and little tact, but unlike some of them he
had sense of humor enough to find out pretty
promptly that he was a young prig.</p>

<p>He soon shed many of his prejudices, and he
was fair-minded enough to let the good wholesome
atmosphere of the campus air out his
sanctimony. This is a way of saying that early
in freshman year he took himself in hand and
decided that if he and a number of other fellows
looked at a number of things in vastly different
ways it did not necessarily follow that the other
fellows were dead wrong. He was in evidence
at class prayer-meetings, but not more than at
the meetings at the lamp-post in front of Reunion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
with his hands doubled up under a
sweater, gossiping with the crowd. That is the
sort of a fellow he was.</p>

<p>Davis's father had a small salary and a large
family, like all missionaries, and one of the girls
had come back to the States when Dougal did to
go to a school in Philadelphia. So young Davis
earned the price of his education.</p>

<p>But this was not so hard as it sounds. Being
a minister's son he had a scholarship, which
saved his tuition bills, and he ran a club, so that
his board cost nothing. Leading the class in
freshman year not only brought him the prize of
$200, but the best kind of advertising with the
faculty as well, so that in sophomore year he had
more tutoring sent around to him than he knew
what to do with. Then he became Princeton
correspondent for several papers, and dropped
tutoring except on special occasions and at very
special rates. He had such a reputation that he
could have had any price he asked. "Go to
Davis; he can put you through any examination,"
they used to say.</p>

<p>In junior year he enlarged his newspaper correspondence
and began doing some syndicate
work. He gained a bit of reputation with football
writing, and in his senior year he used to
sign his name to a column of it every week.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
"The joke of it is," Dougal used to explain, "I
don't know beans about the game." This was
not strictly true, for no one with eyes could go
through four years of tramping down to 'varsity
field without absorbing enough to enlighten the
average sporting editor.</p>

<p>In short, before Davis was three-quarters of
the way through his college course, he was paying
his expenses and making a surplus which
was considerably larger than that which poor
young men who earn their way through college
to preach the Gospel are supposed to
have.</p>

<p>Now he might have sent a portion of it out
to his hard-working parents in Persia, or have
helped to defray the expenses of his ambitious
sister at school. This would have been noble of
him, but he did nothing of the kind. One does
not need much money in Persia; there's nothing
to spend it on. His people had a large, comfortable
home with a dozen servants to look after it,
and they seemed to have leisure enough to write
articles for English and American magazines now
and then. A rich aunt looked out for his sister,
and she had the reputation of dressing more
artistically than any girl in the Walnut Street
school. The only thing he did for her was to
send an occasional box of candy, or a book, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
any other brother. Davis did not even save his
money. He blew it in on himself and his friends,
like any other natural young man. What do you
suppose he worked so hard for if it were not to
go in with the rest of the club for coaches at
Thanksgiving games, and to take runs to Philadelphia
over Sunday, and to give spreads in his
room on Saturday nights, and to do the other
things for which one has sore need of money
and for which he goes broke for about twenty
days of each month? If Davis had been a
modern undergraduate he would perhaps have
spent money on good-looking clothes, though
I hardly think that of him.</p>

<p>The only disadvantage in his way of living
was that it took time, so that he did not have as
much of it to loaf in as he would have liked.
Especially as he was mixed up in half-a-dozen
outside interests of the college world, and had a
provokingly high stand in class to maintain besides.
For although the fellows used to say he
kept on leading his class from force of habit, as
a matter of fact it took considerable valuable
time.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that he had to do his reviewing
up regularly week by week, for he was of
no account at cramming all night for exams, he
said. Perhaps this was true. When the crowd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
used to gather in half-undressed condition with
wet towels around their heads and wild looks on
their faces, Dougal generally stretched out upon
the divan and drummed on a banjo, with his
eyes half closed and a pipe in his mouth, and
listened to the others quizzing and getting excited,
and at twelve o'clock, except on rare occasions,
he said good-night, and went to bed and slept
like a child, and the next day would saunter
into Examination Hall as fresh as a spring term
Sunday, and write the best paper in the class.
It is in this way that many fellows remember
him best.</p>

<p>The reason he never seemed to be especially
rushed was that he had the knack of arranging
his time, and had learned while still in college
that there are a great many moments in twenty-four
hours. He went to breakfast before chapel,
and he crammed a great deal into those odd
hours that come between lectures, which most
fellows spend in making up their minds what to
do, and he found he better appreciated a loaf on
Saturday night if he put in most of the daylight
in work. It was in that way he managed to find
time to keep up his Hall work and attend to his
<i>Princetonian</i> duties and committee meetings
and write orations and essays, besides managing
one of the clubs and turning out an average
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of one thousand words of copy a day in time to
catch the afternoon mail.</p>

<p>And it was in this way that he managed to
keep from breaking down under it. When the
bell in North struck five he always tossed aside
his book and ran down the stairs three steps at
a time and yelled, "Hello, Tommy Tucker," or
"Billy Nolan," or somebody with all his might,
and with him took a rattling hard walk&mdash;not
down Nassau Street, but 'cross country&mdash;or else
an hour's pull at the weights in the gymnasium
with a cold shower-bath and a hard rub at the
end of it, and then walked tingling with health
and content to the club, when he ate the largest
meal of anyone there&mdash;except when big Stehman
was back from the training-table.</p>

<p>After this he stretched his legs far under the
table and leaned his head against the back of
the chair, and there lingered with the coffee and
gossip, blowing beautiful smoke rings for an
hour. He had been known to refuse a $5 tutoring
offer for this hour, just as he had once
sacrificed an elective course in Greek philosophy
for the five o'clock one.</p>

<p>During the past year Davis had been making
up his mind to a few things. One of them was
that he would go out to the foreign field. He
could not say that he felt himself called to it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
He did not sign the pledge that was circulated
about in the colleges at that time as the "Student
volunteer movement."</p>

<p>Ever since he could remember he had intended
to be a preacher, though there was a period,
which came about the same time as his first pair
of trousers, when he thought he would rather
be a dragoman with a fierce mustache and big
buttons. And now he came to the conclusion
that he would become a foreign missionary, like
his father.</p>

<p>He felt that he was pretty well suited to the
work and would make a success of it. He had
a strong constitution, a good voice, and adaptability
to circumstances. He knew pretty well
by nature how to get at people, and the summer
spent slumming down in Rivington Street, New
York, had taught him considerably more. Besides,
he already had the language down fine,
and could stumble along tolerably well with two
of the low dialects.</p>

<p>What is more, he thought he would like it.
He did not tell himself that it was noble to go
and bury himself way out there, for there wasn't
any burying about it. He liked the climate and
expected to have a good time in Persia, with a
man-servant to bow low and make his coffee in
the morning, and to fill his big, long pipe every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
evening, and he pictured himself on a horse
riding beside a certain blue river with peculiar
big trees along the bank quite as often as saving
souls.</p>

<p>At least this is the way he used to talk in pow-wows
in fellows' rooms. But there were certain
long-faced friends of his that misunderstood
when he talked in this manner.</p>

<p class="p2">The salutatorian was not troubling himself
about that just now, as he sat there on the stage
resting his chin on one hand and fanning himself
with a programme in the other. He had
been idly listening to Nolan as he thundered
and perspired about Purity in Politics. For his
part he preferred gamey Billy Nolan, the all-round
athlete, to earnest William the orator.
Nervous little poler Stacy was now straining his
lungs with his well-committed plea for the Greek
Ideal. Davis was not following it very closely.
He glanced down at his classmates in the front
rows. He knew that before the day was over
he was going to feel pretty sad. That was not
troubling him very much now either. But every
time he looked down there a certain thing bobbed
up and spoiled the pleasant taste in his mouth.
It was hardly worth getting uncomfortable over.
This was the way it had begun, long ago last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
fall, as they sat around the table after dinner
talking football. And you can see how ridiculous
it was to worry about it.</p>

<p>Davis was holding forth at some length with
considerable earnestness, as he had a perfect
right to do, of course, and Jim Linton had not
joined in the discussion. He seldom did. He
was quietly sipping his coffee at the end of the
table and looking quizzically interested.</p>

<p>Presently he interrupted. "Oh, Dougal," he
said. He had arisen to go and was refilling his
pipe.</p>

<p>Dougal stopped short. "Yes?" he said in an
intense tone.</p>

<p>Linton looked at him a moment, folded up his
pouch, put it in his pocket, and struck a match.</p>

<p>Then he said, between puffs, "I'd a little rather
you would not get excited, Dougal," and started
off for the billiard-room.</p>

<p>It was nothing but a bit of ordinary club chaff
such as passes back and forth every day, and
Linton forgot the occurrence before he finished
chalking his cue. But Dougal's cheeks had
flushed crimson, and before he knew what he
was saying he had come out with a muttered remark
in which the word "gentleman" was loud
enough for all at the table to hear, and that is a
very awkward word to handle sometimes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>That was the reason no one said anything
for a moment. Silences were rare in that
room. He did not go on with the discussion
of the defective coaching system. Nor did the
others.</p>

<p>A little later as he started for the campus old
Jack Stehman joined him and said, in his sober,
conscientious way, "Say, Dougal, you had no
business saying what you did about Jimmy. Of
course you didn't mean it, but you had better
apologize, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Davis said he did not look at it in that way,
and changed the subject. Before he got to sleep
that night he saw what a fool he had made of
himself, and made up his mind to apologize to
Linton before the whole table. But that was in
the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The next day there were guests at the club.
The following day Linton dined out. The day
after that Davis tried to make himself do it as
they sat about the fireplace, but he postponed
it until some time when his heart was not beating
so loud, for he did not feel himself called
upon to make a scene before the whole club.
When he thought over what he meant to say it
all seemed very ridiculous, and he blushed at
the thought of it. Linton of all fellows would
dislike any slopping over of this sort. So he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
changed his mind and decided to speak to Linton
alone about it.</p>

<p>But it was a very hard thing for a man like
Davis to talk to a man like Linton about a thing
like this. There was something about Linton
that he did not understand. He was the one
man that made him self-conscious. He always
felt as though Linton saw through him and understood
how ambitious he was, and was laughing
at him for his strenuous struggling. He
told himself that he did not propose to be
in awe of a lazy dilettante who thought himself
a clever reader of human nature. But that did
not help him to apologize. And the longer he
put it off the harder it became, naturally. And
the longer he put it off the more he found to dislike
in Linton, which was also natural, only you
would not have thought this of Davis.</p>

<p>After a while he began wondering how he had
taken to Linton in the first place, and why the
other fellows liked him so much. Every time
they were together he began comparing himself
with him. By most standards Davis ought
to have been satisfied. Linton himself never
seemed to think of comparison. He seemed to
calmly take it for granted that Dougal was a
wonderful man, and often referred to it as an
acknowledged fact. He seemed to be glad to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
speak of it. But he had a way of making fellows
love him that was galling to the man that
led the class.</p>

<p>All the college bowed down to Dougal Davis;
not twenty under-classmen knew who Linton
was. But Timberly and Reddy Armstrong and
Jack Stehman had a way of throwing an arm
about lazy Linton, whom they loved, that it did
not occur to them to do with the wonderful Dougal
Davis, whom they admired. Davis wanted
that love. He wanted everything. You see he
had quite a disposition to contend with.</p>

<p>So he kept on having disagreeable times with
himself and the conscience which would not let
up. Finally he made up his mind to patch it all
up on Commencement Day, and he had hit upon
a plan by which he could make just amends to
Linton, he told himself, and duly punish himself
at the same time, and then he could graduate
in peace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he would have to stop thinking
about that and walk down from the stage with
the other Commencement speakers, for Charles
Benjamin Howard had finished telling people
about the Utility of Difference, and the orchestra
was playing "Ta-ra-ra boom de ay."</p>

<p>There was an intermission of ten minutes
now. After that would come the announcement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of prizes and the conferring of degrees, then
Smith's valedictory, followed by the benediction,
and then the class would walk out into the world
with their little diplomas under their arms tied
with pretty ribbons.</p>

<p>The audience changed their positions and
looked about at the other people there, whispered
to each other, and went to fanning again. Some
of the fathers looked at their watches and yawned
and wished Commencement was over with behind
their programmes, and fell to thinking
about things in the office which they had come
here to forget.</p>

<p>Other old grads. smiled kindly, and remembered
how they used to do when they were in
college. The young alumnus looked pityingly at
the graduating class in the front rows and
thought how little these boys knew about the
big world he knew so much of.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the juniors and the lower classmen
were very active and noisy in the rear of
the old church. The Whig men were gathering
on the left-hand side, and Clio Hall on the right.
Many reinforcements were arriving that had not
been near the church during the other exercises.
The aisles became jammed. The seats were
already so.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man jumped up on a pew, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
screamed, "Now, fellows! Clio Hall, this way!
Hip-hip!"</p>

<p>"Clio Hall&mdash;this way!" came out with startling
force from many throats.</p>

<p>This woke everyone up, and those that had
never been there before were a little shocked for
a moment. The loud voices echoed strangely
against the old walls and among the old pillars
and under the old galleries, which by the way
are used to all this and weren't surprised a bit.
No doubt they miss it these days.</p>

<p>Then the left-hand side of the church raised
its voice and said, "Whig Hall, this way! Whig
Hall this wa-ay!" in still fiercer tones. Then
Clio called itself together again, and then Whig
Hall cheered and so did Clio, and gave a long
cheer and so did Whig. Then both cheered for
themselves at once, and tried to drown each
other out, and succeeded. They kept this up
until time was called. That is, the clerk of the
board of trustees arose and stretched his long
neck and began to announce the prizes from a
long list in his hand. This was interesting.</p>

<p>Whenever he read out an award in his strong
voice, it was met with a tremendous cheer from
the Hall whose member won the prize. It mattered
not whether the honor was one for which
a literary society's training could count; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
cheered anyway, whether it was a fellowship in
modern languages or a prize in the School of
Science draughtsmanship. Nor did it matter
whether the man had never since the first week
after his initiation worked the combination
lock of the Hall door. They cheered him anyway.
And when the two societies were in doubt
as to which he belonged to, they both cheered.
It made magnificent noise.</p>

<p>There are a great many of these prizes. One
has no idea until Commencement comes that
there are so many advertised in the catalogue;
and the clerk read each one out in a loud voice,
and then waited for the cheering to cease.</p>

<p>Dougal Davis had heard his name announced
three times, and each time the cheer rang out
from the enthusiastic throng in the rear he felt
the little echoing thrill inside of him.</p>

<p>Once as he stepped down from the platform
he caught a glimpse of a man leading the cheer
for him. The man's back was turned, but he
saw him standing there 'way up on the railing
of the pew in his excitement, and he saw his
arms vigorously jerking out the cheer.</p>

<p>Davis was used to this sort of thing and he
held his features very well, though as he
marched up for the third time he felt rather
foolish, for the audience were smiling audibly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the sight of Dougal Davis, of Persia, running off
with so many prizes. Timberly asked him
when he came down, "Why don't you stay up
there, Dougal? I'd sit on the edge platform
and swing my legs."</p>

<p>It was only at the announcement of the Lynde
prize debate that he felt at all tremulous. His
friends kept telling him that he was sure of it,
but he felt that he would not get it. This is, as
everyone knows, the greatest inter-Hall prize
offered, and many people consider it the greatest
honor of a college lifetime. It was quite
enough for a fellow to feel weak at the stomach
over. Dougal kept repeating under his
breath, "What's the difference, what's the difference?"
and he reminded himself that there
were a second and a third prize as well as the
first, and that any way, even if he won none of
them, it was a pretty fine thing to have secured
the appointment from his Hall. Besides, he was
doing so many things that he could afford to
drop an honor or two.</p>

<p>"The Lynde Prize Debate," came in the resonant
tones of the tall, gaunt clerk. Everything
was very still.</p>

<p>The cheerers were silent. The two leaders
were standing on tip-toe, each with his elbows
doubled up and mouth half open, ready to begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the cheer. One of them, however, would
have to keep still. Dougal shut his lips.</p>

<p>"First prize awarded to Dougal Davis, of
Pers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then came the loud, eager "'Ray! 'Ray!
'Ray!'" of the quick cheer, and then two more
quick ones, and next a long one with "Davis!"
on the end, then the word "Davis! Davis!
Davis!" that way, three times. Then they
began giving more quick cheers again and a
few long ones, as if they had just started.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the clerk kept his sober gaze upon
the paper in his hand, waiting to announce the
second and third winners and pretending to be
annoyed at the delay, though enjoying it as
much as any girl in the audience.</p>

<p>"Good work, Dougal, good work," cried one
of the four fellows pounding him on the back.</p>

<p>Dougal did not smile slightly or look unconcerned.
He grinned all over his face and enjoyed
it. As soon as the attention was taken
away from him he leaned back in the corner of
the pew and enjoyed it some more. That is the
way to do.</p>

<p>He was still tense and excited from his victory
when a few minutes later he heard the
clerk reading off something about the new fellowship
in Political Science. This was the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
he had gone in for, and he had felt doubtful over
the result, because he had not been able to spend
as much time upon it as he wanted to, and it required
a great deal. However, the only other
man in the race was nothing to be afraid of.
But all the same a little dart of dread shot
through him now, and he thought what if he
should lose it after all. It would not do at all.
This was what he wanted more than any of the
honors. He had a particular reason for wanting
to win it. This he failed to do.</p>

<p>Before he was quite aware of what was taking
place the clerk had already made the announcement
and the crowd were wildly cheering, cheering
that other fellow as if they had never heard
of Dougal Davis. He felt like a man that steps
off a bridge in the dark; he heard the splash and
felt a shock, but he did not know just what had
happened. He had never been beaten in anything
before. It came very hard. But that was
not what made it hurt so much. It was because
Linton had won it.</p>

<p>He could not help thinking of the little speech
he had planned to make that evening&mdash;"Well,
you see, Jimmie, I haven't time for it, anyway. I
have to go to the Seminary, and maybe to the
Medical College after that. So I thought I would
resign, and I hope you'll apply for it and come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
back to the old place for another year. You're
sure to get it, if you apply for it." Wasn't it a
pretty little speech?</p>

<p>He turned and glanced over at Linton, who
sat with his head nestled contentedly against
Reddy Armstrong's shoulder, while the happy-looking
fellows all around him were punching
and pounding him and rumpling up his hair as
if they never would cease; and as if they were
glad Dougal Davis was beaten. Linton himself
only raised his eyebrows and shook his
head deprecatingly. He seemed to take it all
very easily, as if he were accustomed to winning
prizes and beating Dougal Davis, and he
still wore that imperturbable look, and Davis
knew that it would have been just as imperturbable
and contented looking if he had lost.</p>

<p>And this spoiled the salutatorian's day of
triumph. He did not glance back now to where
his sister and aunt were sitting. He forgot to
unroll his sheepskin as the others did when
they came down from the stage with them. He
blew his breath through it against the palm of
his hand and looked absent-mindedly at the
scratched paint of the old-fashioned pew. He
remained thus all through Smith's valedictory,
except once when the speaker stretched out both
arms and the class arose; then he listened for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
moment and said, "Biff!" under his breath.
When it was all over he passed out with his class
and through the gazing throng, thinking not of
the much that he had won, but only of the one
thing he had lost, and this was unfortunate, because
much people were looking at him and
thinking how fine it was to be Davis, and that is
fame, and it was too bad to miss it.</p>

<p class="p2">Linton had no ambition and he colored meerschaum
beautifully. He was usually mum in a
crowd, but he was fine company on a long
cross-country walk, and he knew more about
ordering a dinner than any man on the campus,
except one of the faculty.</p>

<p>When he did not want you in his room he
told you so, and he was the kind of a fellow you
would do anything for after you came to know
him.</p>

<p>He had a very efficient sense of humor, which
does not mean that he said funny things at the
table. Some people thought him sarcastic. But
many fellows went to him for advice or sympathy,
and it was not only because he could keep
his mouth absolutely closed.</p>

<p>Linton had a walking acquaintance with every
road, lane, and pathway within a radius of twenty
miles of the campus. He knew how long it took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
to cover any route, and where there were good
places to stop and rest, especially the quaint
ones where they served it in mugs.</p>

<p>Here he used to sit and sip and smoke the
golden afternoon away, dreaming of how it all
must have been years ago in the old stage coach
days when the horses drew up on the clattering
cobble-stones and the passengers alighted and
looked about and asked how many more miles
it was, and the red-faced driver jumped down
from the box and swaggered into the tap-room,
and called for a pint of ale, and told the landlord
how bad the pike was near New Brunswick.</p>

<p>He considered himself somewhat of an artist.
There were ever so many bits that he was fond
of showing you if he thought you could appreciate
them; like the bend in the canal up toward
Baker's basin, with peculiar water and willow-coloring
in springtime. Linton said it was
like a French water-color. He used to carry a
gun over his shoulder, and say he was going
snipe-shooting; really it was to look for things
like this, and get up a big appetite for dinner.
He could also point out a view of gentle hills
and rolling green fields on the way to Kingston
that was a good imitation of English landscape,
he said, and he knew just where the tower of
the School of Science ought to make an effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
through treetops, like the view of Magdalen
tower from a point in Addison's walk, if it were
only beautiful Gothic instead of ugly Renaissance.
But perhaps all this was merely to show
that he had once canoed down the Thames from
Oxford to London.</p>

<p>He was very well up in the ancient history of
the town, also. He knew all about most of the
old houses, and he had sketches of the best of
the old brass-knockers and colonial doorways.
It is said that he used to prowl about on moonlight
nights for this purpose. Small window-panes
were another thing he was insane over.
He had substituted for the ordinary panes of
his windows, dingy little square ones with thick
frames painted black. Some of the fellows said
the reason he did this was to be odd. Linton
blew smoke, and said yes, that was the reason.</p>

<p>But it was the old campus that he loved the
most. He knew just about all there was to find
out about it, and dreamed a great deal more.</p>

<p>He had ever so many favorite aspects, such
as the one of the back of the Dean's house&mdash;with
small, square window-panes&mdash;from away over at
a point between Whig and Clio Halls, and the
rear view of Prospect across the stretch of sloping
meadow toward the canal, and a number of
congenial little spots that meant something to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
him, like the stone buttress at the bottom of the
tower of Witherspoon, a great place to warm
your back against in spring sunshine, with the
blue smoke trickling lazily from your mouth and
the fellows batting up flies on the old diamond;
and then for midnight chats there were the
smooth steps of chapel with the elms saying
things in low tones overhead. But those midnight
chats were all over now. It was Commencement
Day, and it was the saddest thing
that had ever happened to Linton.</p>

<p>He was not at all anxious to spring forth into
the world and battle with opportunity and all
the other things that the class-day speakers and
the valedictorian said that he was going to do.
He thought this little world was good enough
for him, and there wasn't much spring in him.</p>

<p>Ever since he could read he had been told
that youth was the happiest time in life, and he
had come to the conclusion that it must be so.
He did not like the idea of giving it up. He
had become well settled where he was, and had
just gotten rid of a persistent siege of kid-pessimism&mdash;of
which he was now very much ashamed&mdash;and
was just beginning to realize what a big,
beautiful, real thing friendship was, and now&mdash;Jack
and Timber and Billy and Red, where
would they all be in three days' time? It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
seemed pretty sudden, this thing of breaking
up.</p>

<p>And there was very little comfort to him in
the thought of coming back next year. What
would the old place be without the old class.
He did not like to think about it.</p>

<p>It struck the class as a pretty joke for Jimmie
Linton to bob up and win a fellowship. "How
did you happen to do it?" said Tucker, on the
way out of church. "I didn't know you had
any brains."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" said Linton; "I've quite a lot
of them. And I worked like a good little boy
for that fellowship; but nobody will give me any
credit for it. They all know that if Dougal
hadn't been too busy with other things, I would
have had no show." He was quite right. There
was nothing modest in this. Dougal Davis had
about as good powers of acquisition as anyone
graduated since the time of Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>Political science was not strictly in Linton's
line. He wrote things for the Lit., and elected
all the English courses. He was a great browser
in Elizabethan literature, and when he dabbled
in verse this was evident. One of the
exchanges once called him a nineteenth century
Herrick. Linton felt right pleased, and
wrote something nice about the University of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Virginia man that said it in the next Lit., and
also made it an excuse to give one of his famous
spreads. You would have expected him to go in
for an English fellowship, if for any. But he
did not go in for any deliberately. He was not
in the habit of studying his courses more than
enough to get through the examinations, except
when he ran across something he was interested
in, or a professor he liked. There are many excuses
for laziness.</p>

<p>In Political Economy, and such subjects,
he liked the lecturer very much, and he found
himself becoming interested in the primitive
man, and the origin of society, and all that. The
farther he went in the course, the more interested
he became. He went to the library, and
often walked past the Elizabethan alcove. Next
he began buying the books, because he liked to
feel that he owned them, and rub them up
against his cheek, and he soon had a shelf full
of Bagehot and big, thick Sir Henry Maine and
others.</p>

<p>Then because he had never done anything
serious during his course, and because he knew
it would please his people and amuse the fellows,
he announced his intention of trying for
the Political Science fellowship. There was no
one else in for it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>He went about it scientifically, and was surprised
to find how much enthusiasm he had
aroused in himself. He had never known before
what a fine thing study was. He said he
wished he had done more of it during his college
course.</p>

<p>He was surprised when he heard a few weeks
later that Dougal Davis was in the field. Historical
work he thought was still further out of
Davis's line. But he only rolled over on the
divan and went on reading. For he argued
thus: "I like this stuff and I don't see how it
can hurt me to learn a lot about something. If
I don't fetch a fellowship I won't have to correct
examination papers. I'd hate to correct examination
papers."</p>

<p>One day at the club he asked Dougal&mdash;he sat
opposite&mdash;what he wanted with political science.
Davis cleared his throat and said every
preacher of modern times should know something
of sociology, which was undoubtedly true.
But that was not the reason. And somehow
Linton guessed it.</p>

<p class="p2">It was twilight and the class had gathered together
on the steps of Old North for their last
senior singing. Only they were no longer seniors;
it was "by and by" now, and they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
out in the "wide, wide world." They huddled
up close together as if half frightened at the
thought of its being the last time.</p>

<p>There were but few undergrads. stretched
out under the elms to listen, and most of these
were the juniors&mdash;seniors they were now&mdash;waiting
to rapaciously take possession of the steps
the moment the present occupants marched off
for their last supper together at nightfall.
These and a handful of the out-of-town visitors
were all that were left of the big Commencement
crowds that had been gathering there every
evening to hear the seniors sing. Sometimes
they had felt that they would have preferred
being left a little more to themselves, if it were
possible, during the last days of college life.</p>

<p>But now this unmolested aloneness only
added to their dreariness and made them feel
the ghastly certainty of this evening's being the
end of all. The grass was trampled and faded,
and the crowd that had trodden it was gone.
The bell in Old North belfry rang out painfully
loud.</p>

<p>"Well, fellows, let's sing," said the leader,
rising slowly. He raised his chin and then
bobbed his head and started up, "The Orange
and the Black," just as they had all seen him
do many times before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>They sang as they had never sung before.
It did not matter what were the words of the
song. "They stole his wallet, they stole his
staff," had nothing in it that was especially apropos
of college friendships or the sadness of farewell,
but the way they sang it, with the long-drawn
"Ramski Ho," meant something. It was
so full of association. And no one noticed this
time whether the man behind him was on a key
of his own. His only thought was, "When shall
I hear Billy's good old bark again after to-night?"
And when Sam's and when Ed's and
Big Hill's and Little Hill's and where would be
the fellow a year from now whose shoulder was
next to his own.</p>

<p>During the past month or two the class of
Ninety Blank had been drawn very close together
by the thought of what was coming.
They had never been very seriously cliqued up,
but what there was of dissension was forgotten,
and they were now one solid crowd. Fellows
who had never anything to do with each other
before except to say, "Hello, there, Ray!" and
"Hello, Harry!" had taken to strolling around
the campus together arm-in-arm talking about
what they were going to do next year and wondering
why they had never happened to see
more of each other in the past, and regretting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
that there were to be no opportunities for doing
so in the future.</p>

<p>But during the excitement of Commencement
week, with the crowds of old grads. and of girls
and the big baseball game and the concerts and
Class Day full of its exhibition farewells in the
church and around the cannon, and the teas and
the big dance on Tuesday night, and the many
other things that filled up every moment of
every day and night&mdash;together with the responsibility
of seeing to the entertainment of their
guests&mdash;all this, and the feeling of importance
at being the cause of so much color and sound
had in a measure distracted their minds from
the thought of what it all meant. But now all
that was changed.</p>

<p>The last of the display ceremonies was finished.
The class had their diplomas. It was
all over. The rollicking old grads. with their
many reunions and their old-fashioned cheers
and their funny songs had left for the city and
business again for a year. The girls and their
mothers and their parasols had vanished like
the chinese lanterns among the trees. The
campus was almost deserted, and except for their
own voices, was as still as a cemetery. Each
man on the steps was realizing as he never had
done before how glad had been those four years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and how startlingly fast they had sped by, and
how much more these friends of his meant to him
than he had ever imagined friends could mean.</p>

<p>Two of the number had been obliged to pack
their trunks and depart during the afternoon
without waiting for the banquet. The whole
class were at the station to see them off. They
did it in the old-fashioned way, with much cheering
and singing, and the old custom of lifting
them up and putting them through the car windows.
Then after each man had shaken the
hands of those departing, and said, "God bless
you, Tommy," they had watched while the little
train rolled down the grade and became smaller
and smaller, and they cheered until the two men
waving their hats on the rear platform were hidden
behind the curve. Then they marched solemnly
back across the campus again, and tried
to go on with the packing of their own trunks.</p>

<p>But few had been able to remain very long in
the lonely, old, familiar dens. There were too
many things to suggest the old times which sent
big wedges into throats, and they realized that
there were to be few enough opportunities of
being with those fellows out under the trees to
waste time in dreary packing. "It's too deuced
hot up there in my room," said Harry Lawrence
to Billy Nolan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>For the most part they had spent the afternoon
in silent, moody wanderings, in groups of
twos and fours and half dozens, all about the
old, dear, familiar landmarks of the campus.
Now at evening they were gathered together as
a body again. This was to be the last time.
And that thought kept recurring to each man on
the steps.</p>

<p>It was about dusk now. The front campus
was wrapped in that strange half-glow that sometimes
comes at late senior singing time. It was
very much in keeping with other elements of the
scene, and it had its effect upon the fellows.</p>

<p>Old North seemed solemn and dignified, but
somehow more gentle and caressable than formerly.
Even the old elms, who have seen this
thing happen so many, many times, ceased
whispering for a space and listened. John, the
college policeman, left Reunion for his home
down William Street, and Sam, the night watchman,
said, "Good-night, John," and took his
place. Bill Leggett took down his lantern and
started around to light the campus lamps as he
always did at this hour. The village street
seemed far off, and its lights and its bit of life
seemed part of another world. There was a
pause in the singing.</p>

<p>It lasted a long time. Tucker scratched a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
match on the stone steps. The crack seemed
very loud. Those near by turned and watched
him light his pipe and watched him throw the
match to the ground. It kept on burning for
a little while. They watched it until it went
out.</p>

<p>Presently Doc. Devereaux, the leader, said,
"Fellows, there are a lot of chairs and benches
scattered about. Let's drag them up here in
front of the steps and make a circle." They
all arose and did it as if it had been a command.</p>

<p>The rattling of the chairs against each other
sounded harsh and discordant, and yet no one
seemed to want to lessen it. Some of the fellows
laughed and joked a little, as though they weren't
thinking of anything serious. It made a large
circle. They sat down in comparative silence.
The Class President arose and said, "Say, fellows,
let's sing 'Here's to you, my jovial friend,'
all around the class, and each man stand up
while we're singing to him."</p>

<p>They started with the President and went
around to the left. You know that drinking
song. It's a simple little salute, but there's more
heart in its swelling high notes than in anything
ever written. But perhaps that is because of
its association.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span></p>

<p>"Here's to you, Jack Stehman," they sang.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Here's to you, my jovial friend,</p>
<p>And we'll drink with all our heart,</p>
<p>For sake of company&mdash;</p>
<p>We'll drink before we part,</p>
<p>Here's to you, Jack Stehman."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Stehman, the President, had arisen when his
name was called, and remained standing while
the song was carried through. The big fellow
seemed to loom up bigger than ever in the half
dark. He arose with his old, well-known slouch,
and the sight of this little characteristic brought
up to every one of them the whole big, lovable
personality of the man.</p>

<p>He started to look around at the fellows and
smile as they began to sing, but the clear, warm
notes rang out, "We'll drink before we part,"
and he changed his mind and looked down
at the grass under his feet. He was not embarrassed.
He merely preferred looking down.
It was so different from Class Day, when he had
made his much-applauded President's address,
and told people in his nice set speech about the
sadness of farewell and the beauty of the elms.
He was the one all the girls had asked the most
questions about. The class censor had guyed
him about his brand new dignity and his good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
looks. Nobody was feeling like guying him
now.</p>

<p>Little Stacy sat next. He did not stand up
very high. There was not much to him. He
had been a poler all through the course, and you
would not have expected the thing to affect him
very much, but you could see his thin hands
working nervously along the edge of his coat
as he looked about at the half-darkened crowd
of faces, and he smiled his foolish, little, self-conscious
smile. The little chap had no idea
that they would ever sing to him in that way,
and when he heard Harry Lawrence's strong
bass come out with "And we'll drink with all
our heart," he fairly quivered. When he sat
down the President reached a big arm about
him.</p>

<p>Then came Reddy Armstrong. He was not
very tall either. He stood up very straight and
stiff with his round, freckled face screwed up
into funny twists. He only stared straight
ahead into nothing. He looked dazed. He was
dazed. He had been through some very queer
things that day. "Poor little Red," thought
Linton as he looked at him.</p>

<p>All around the big circle went the song until
it ended with Timberly, who sat on Stehman's
right. By this time it was too dark to see Timberly's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
queer features. Perhaps it was just as
well.</p>

<p>"Now," said the President, simply, "let's all
cross hands and sing 'Auld Lang Syne.' Doc.,
start it up, please."</p>

<p>They arose, and each man gave his right-hand
comrade his left hand, and his left-hand comrade
his right, and they sang the good old song in
the good old way, with the clasped hands swinging
far up and down in time to the music.</p>

<p>Presently the song was finished. It seemed
to stop suddenly. They all waited a moment in
silence to see whether the leader had another
verse to begin.</p>

<p>But he did not. Jack Stehman stepped out
into the middle of the ring. "Now, fellows," he
said, "let's give three good rousing cheers for
the dear old class&mdash;God bless every man in it&mdash;and
then we'll give up the steps to the juniors&mdash;the
seniors I mean&mdash;and march four
abreast to the dinner. Are you ready? Hip!
hip! ... another one&mdash;Hip! hip!"</p>

<p>Linton was standing apart over beside the
steps. His back was turned toward the others.</p>

<p>While the rest were cheering, Dougal Davis
crossed over to him.</p>

<p>"Jim," he said, "I haven't congratulated you
yet on winning the fellowship."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>Linton kept on looking at the newly planted
class ivy. His hands were in his pockets and
his legs spread apart.</p>

<p>"Did you notice that I hadn't, Jim?"</p>

<p>Linton turned around suddenly. "Oh, yes, I
noticed it. But that was this morning." He
put his hand on Davis's shoulder as in junior
year.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Dougal," he said; "we haven't any
time to waste in talk."</p>

<p>"All right," said Dougal. "Don't let's be left
behind. They are starting." He laughed a little.
It was a foolish-sounding laugh. Linton
did not observe that. He laughed also, in very
much the same way.</p>

<p>They stepped in line with the others and
marched off the campus singing, with all their
might,</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Nassau! Nassau! Ring out the chorus free.</p>
<p>Nassau! Nassau! Thy jolly sons are we.</p>
<p>Care shall be forgotten, all our sorrows flung away,</p>
<p class="i2">While we are marching thro' Princeton."</p>
